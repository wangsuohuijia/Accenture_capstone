On the keyboard, you can simply press Shift + F10 to achieve this ‘right-click‘ effect - perhaps your mouse is setup as left handed... not sure what the left click shortcut is
2011-10-25T01:48:00.000Z	p1ruj3	digz	do youhave another mouse to try?
2011-10-25T01:50:00.000Z	p1ruj3	digz	try disabling the trackpad in bios

2011-10-25T01:54:00.000Z	p1ruj3	digz	i doubt this will work but fn f9 i think is the disable toggle
