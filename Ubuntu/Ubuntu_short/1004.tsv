2011-11-01T23:28:00.000Z	IsmAvatar		I have an ATI radeon x1300, but glxgears is running at 55 fps. I think the driver's not installed right. Can someone help me get it installed right?
2011-11-01T23:30:00.000Z	RiXtEr-home	IsmAvatar	i was having a similar issue with nvidia, downgraded the kernel to 2.6.38-12-generic and my fps got a whole bunch better.
2011-11-01T23:30:00.000Z	RiXtEr-home	IsmAvatar	I wouldn't recomend doing that though.
2011-11-01T23:31:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	RiXtEr-home	I think that's overkill. All I need to do is install the driver, but I haven't found anywhere that shows how to do it
2011-11-01T23:31:00.000Z	RiXtEr-home	IsmAvatar	the 3.0 kernel that 11.10 uses has issues (clearly) but you can search around for fglrx (iirc)
2011-11-01T23:36:00.000Z	RiXtEr-home	IsmAvatar	you might give this a try.

2011-11-01T23:37:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	RiXtEr-home	trying that now
2011-11-01T23:38:00.000Z	RiXtEr-home	IsmAvatar	scroll up and read that big red box.
2011-11-01T23:39:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	RiXtEr-home	don't think that pertains to me. I didn't go to the Radeon website or anything. This is essentially a fresh install of Oneiric
2011-11-01T23:39:00.000Z	RiXtEr-home	IsmAvatar	alright, just be aware that if your card won't run with the fglrx driver, you may end up with a cli system only
2011-11-01T23:44:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	RiXtEr-home	if that happens, I'm doing a fresh install of oneiric and we'll be right back to where we started, minus a couple hours lost, so no biggy
2011-11-01T23:44:00.000Z	RiXtEr-home	IsmAvatar	just letting you know you may end up with a hosed system ;)
2011-11-01T23:46:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	RiXtEr-home	I got stuck. "sudo: aticonfig: command not found"
2011-11-01T23:58:00.000Z	RiXtEr-home	IsmAvatar	did  sudo dpkg -i fglrx*.deb complete?
2011-11-02T00:04:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	RiXtEr-home	yes
