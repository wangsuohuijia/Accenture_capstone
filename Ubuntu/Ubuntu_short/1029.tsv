2011-10-30T16:13:00.000Z	hrolf		Anyone knows if installing Windows will mess up with grub (and probably mess with Ubuntu)?
2011-10-30T16:14:00.000Z	hrolf		Will it get picked up too?
2011-10-30T16:16:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	hrolf	This should help immensely: http://goo.gl/DIoMX
2011-10-30T17:28:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	hrolf	Did you have a look at the link that I gave you, a while ago? http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/index
2011-10-30T17:29:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	hrolf	It should answer just about any questions that you may have..
2011-10-30T19:42:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	hrolf	The funny thing about Brassero is it gives screwy error messages but burns the CD fine, with no problems; go figure.
2011-10-30T19:44:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	hrolf	That's the beauty of FOSS; there's a ton of burning software, at your finger tips, try as many as you want and stick with what works best for you.
2011-12-31T15:29:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	hrolf	I would assume that "normal" FF is windows based and the latter linux based; different directory structure, different plug-ins, etc..
2011-12-31T15:30:00.000Z	hrolf	Sidewinder1	By 'windows based' do you mean MS Windows OS?
2011-12-31T15:30:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	hrolf	Yes.
2011-12-31T15:31:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	hrolf	I'm assuming that's what you meant by 'normal.'
2011-12-31T15:32:00.000Z	hrolf	Sidewinder1	If the other one is for Linux, then why is it Ubuntu only. Shouldn't it be like Firefox for Linux rather than Firefox for Ubuntu
2011-12-31T15:33:00.000Z	hrolf	Sidewinder1	I think it is mostly like something with Ubuntu
2011-12-31T15:36:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	hrolf	Perhaps have a look here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox  It states that it's linux compatible as well as other OSs.. Most certainly not an exclusive ubuntu browser regarding it's *nix varient.
2011-12-31T15:37:00.000Z	hrolf	Sidewinder1	I know that. I think you didn't understand the problem (or I failed to explain it.)
2011-12-31T15:39:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	hrolf	Perhaps you're correct; it's early, here and I need my second cup-o-coffee. Please feel free to restate your question.. BRB.
