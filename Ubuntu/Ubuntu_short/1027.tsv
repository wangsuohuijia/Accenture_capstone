2011-11-15T17:14:00.000Z	VictorCL		is there a big difference between 11.04 and 11.10 ¿
2011-11-15T17:14:00.000Z	VictorCL		should I upgrade¿
2011-11-15T17:15:00.000Z	crizzy	VictorCL	i would actually recommend waiting for 12.04, gnome3 is still missing a lot of old configuration options
2011-11-15T17:16:00.000Z	crizzy	VictorCL	configuration tools are a big mess, you can't even change fonts without "tweak tools"
2011-11-15T17:18:00.000Z	crizzy	VictorCL	better fix. take screwdriver, rip off your caps lock key
2012-03-02T14:47:00.000Z	crizzy	VictorCL	next month
2012-03-02T14:47:00.000Z	crizzy	VictorCL	ubuntu versioning is year.month yy.mm
2012-03-02T14:47:00.000Z	crizzy	VictorCL	and releases happen always .04 and .10. with only one exception so far which was 6.06, which was delayed 2 months to give it extra stability
