2011-10-28T20:26:00.000Z	brin		how can one go about finding a reasonably safe program for their purposes, that isn't listed in the software center?
2011-10-28T20:26:00.000Z	Fodi69	brin	for example, http://alternativeto.net if you know a similar program
2011-10-28T20:29:00.000Z	Fodi69		can I figure out somehow, which application wants to access my keyring???? It shows up automatically
2011-10-28T20:29:00.000Z	brin	Fodi69	and you feel you can trust that website to vet the installs properly?
2011-10-28T20:29:00.000Z	brin		Anyone know of a good zip file password cracker for ubuntu?
2011-10-28T20:30:00.000Z	Fodi69	brin	you can find software there, and than go to the providers homepage and download, it is for FINDING sotfware, not installing

2011-10-28T20:31:00.000Z	brin		jason_,  AFIAK, one option is running sound through video card, where as the other is running it direct, not sure of the real difference, but you only need one, a second just means conflict
2011-10-28T20:31:00.000Z	Fodi69	brin	fcrackzip ??

2011-10-28T20:32:00.000Z	Fodi69		can I figure out somehow, which application wants to access my keyring? It shows up automatically
2011-10-28T20:33:00.000Z	brin	Fodi69	ok but it doesn't seem to have a GUI that I can find (maybe one I am not seeing?) and without that, I am lost, too technical
2011-10-28T20:35:00.000Z	Fodi69	brin	yeah, its a terminal program, you can only use it from the terminal, but it is the answer to your question
2011-10-28T20:35:00.000Z	brin		jason_, you have a sound card? Or integrated sound? Either way, direct is using that. It SOUNDS to me like your using, or trying to use, the video card method, but i can't say much more then that because it goes above my head

2011-10-28T20:36:00.000Z	brin	Fodi69	well, not without reasonably easy to understand instructions for it
