2011-12-22T19:51:00.000Z	deej1976	dp	have you run a "sudo apt-get upgrade" ?
2011-12-22T19:53:00.000Z	dp	deej1976	yes. that's actually what uninstalled empathy in the first place
2011-12-22T19:54:00.000Z	deej1976	dp	What did you install to cause empathy to uninstall ? have you added an empathy PPA
2011-12-22T19:55:00.000Z	dp	deej1976	I did an upgrade. AFAIK, I have no empathy PPAs
2011-12-22T19:58:00.000Z	deej1976	dp	Sorry, if you've not got any extra ppa's enabled, and it was removed with an upgrade, it's past my experiences
