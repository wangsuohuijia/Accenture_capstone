2011-10-28T00:35:00.000Z	robin0800	ubidoobi2	if you have installed the raid device on an hd that is excluded from the installer
2011-10-28T00:36:00.000Z	ubidoobi2	robin0800	drive is set to IDE
2011-10-28T00:38:00.000Z	robin0800	ubidoobi2	if you have more than one hd the partioner ask if you want to install the raid device if you do that disc is then excluded from the installer
