2012-03-05T03:31:00.000Z	PhantomPhreak53		Ok I have been fighting with this all day and can't seem to get it back up and running. Basically when I do apt-get upgrade I get this error: http://pastebin.com/ZBbnx4zE I have tried reinstall php, apt-get -f install, tried removing the packages and nothing seems to work
