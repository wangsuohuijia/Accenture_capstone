2011-10-28T00:57:00.000Z	hid	Chraz_Ritt	I want to recover the partition. Data aren't deleted but I cannot access to them.
2011-10-28T00:58:00.000Z	Chraz_Ritt	hid	what (if anything) did you do to the partition before you lost access to the data?
2011-10-28T01:00:00.000Z	hid	Chraz_Ritt	I resized it. I remove 20 Gib for linux.

2011-10-28T01:05:00.000Z	Chraz_Ritt	hid	did you use it for storage while using windows?
2011-10-28T01:07:00.000Z	hid	Chraz_Ritt	I was on linux when it happened. An only storage partiton yes.
2011-10-28T01:08:00.000Z	Chraz_Ritt	hid	but was it used by windows? could it have needed defragging?
2011-10-28T01:09:00.000Z	hid	Chraz_Ritt	the partition wasn't fragmented (0%). I took every precaution in order to install linux distribution.
2011-10-28T01:10:00.000Z	Chraz_Ritt	hid	have you tried mounting it from ubuntu?
2011-10-28T01:13:00.000Z	hid	Chraz_Ritt	Yeah I tried but ubuntu doesn't recognise it. Ubuntu proposes to delete the partiton :'(.
