2011-11-04T00:42:00.000Z	Guinness2702		Anybody know how I can tell the resolver to try the other servers, if the first entry in resolv.conf returns "not found" ???
2011-11-04T00:43:00.000Z	riffautae	Guinness2702	it should automaticcly do that
2011-11-04T00:44:00.000Z	Guinness2702	riffautae	no, it only tries the next one if it fails to connect to the DN Server.  If it *successfully* connects, but that returns "not found" it doesn't look at the others
2011-11-04T00:45:00.000Z	riffautae	Guinness2702	i see, odd
2011-11-04T00:45:00.000Z	riffautae	Guinness2702	well I guess not that odd, is there a particular domain name it is having issues with?
2011-11-04T00:45:00.000Z	riffautae	Guinness2702	the hosts file or a local dns server might help with that
2011-11-04T00:47:00.000Z	Guinness2702	riffautae	yeah, I could do that, but I don't want to duplicate the vpn's entire dns locally, and then keep it up to date :(
2011-11-04T00:48:00.000Z	riffautae	Guinness2702	you might be able to get the local dns server to just cache and load from both dns servers rather then manually copy the dns
2011-11-04T00:48:00.000Z	Guinness2702	riffautae	yeah, but if the cache got a miss, it would still go to the vpn first
2011-11-04T00:49:00.000Z	riffautae	Guinness2702	i'm just imagining that the dns cacher might be more configurable
2011-11-04T00:52:00.000Z	riffautae	Guinness2702	if its only one top level domain you could make the local dns server claim to be the master dns server for that domain and have it cache from the one on the vpn
2011-11-04T00:53:00.000Z	riffautae	Guinness2702	such as example.com
2011-11-04T00:53:00.000Z	Guinness2702	riffautae	yeah, that's sorta what I was thinking...but that means setting up a local DNS lol
2011-11-04T00:56:00.000Z	riffautae	Guinness2702	you could also use a socks proxy and set your software to send dns through it
2011-11-04T00:56:00.000Z	riffautae	Guinness2702	firefox supports this
2011-11-04T00:56:00.000Z	Guinness2702	riffautae	I probably ssh as much as http
