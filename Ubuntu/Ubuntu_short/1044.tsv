2011-12-02T17:38:00.000Z	deej1976	aum___	ubuntu-desktop is a meta-package if you look at the contents it will list the packages
2011-12-02T17:39:00.000Z	aum___	deej1976	i know but it installs many other applications which i do not want
2011-12-02T17:41:00.000Z	deej1976	aum___	I said look at the package not install it, it will list all the packages that make ubuntu-desktop including the gnome related packages
