2011-11-02T22:14:00.000Z	eHAPPY		could i make folders inside that one and write to those?
2011-11-02T22:14:00.000Z	riffautae	eHAPPY	you could change the owner of the file to you or alternativly the group to users and then only add write access to that
2011-11-02T22:15:00.000Z	eHAPPY		ok and thats the only way?
2011-11-02T22:15:00.000Z	eHAPPY		or the best way*
2011-11-02T22:15:00.000Z	riffautae	eHAPPY	depends on your use case, what is the folder?
2011-11-02T22:15:00.000Z	eHAPPY	riffautae	its just a watch folder for rtorrent
2011-11-02T22:16:00.000Z	riffautae	eHAPPY	so you want rtorrent and yourself to be able to write to it?
