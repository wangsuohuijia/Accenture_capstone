2009-03-08T23:34:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	that's what I was trying to work with him with, but clearly he's too upset to solve the problem
2009-03-08T23:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	you were trying to do what?
2009-03-08T23:35:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	read scrollback
2009-03-08T23:35:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	what?
2009-03-08T23:37:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	that's not supporting Ubuntu very well. who are you?
2009-03-09T00:01:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	that is ENOUGH.
2009-03-09T00:03:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	that's quite a bit of work for just a simple procedure
2009-03-09T00:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	what was enough?
2009-03-09T00:04:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	when you say that the linux alternative html editors aren't all that good. I've never had a problem with them, and thousands of others haven't either.
2009-03-09T00:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	I would rather hand code than use a WYSIWYG :)  yes it takes longer, but much more control over my code, so  no junk code, and then it's great fun to validate it on w3.org
2009-03-09T00:05:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	that's fine, but don't push your method down someone elses throat when they're clearly looking to use a different method. kthx :)
2009-03-09T00:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	Seamonkey makes sense though,  browser, HTML editor, and that all in one
2009-03-17T20:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	 :D  cool  altough not to sure what Lg is, but anyway  ogg vorbis :)
2009-03-17T20:52:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	LG is a company that makes hardware and other peripherals, such as mp3 players, cd/dvd drives, dvd players, TVs, etc :)
2009-03-18T04:56:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	*content!* :)
2009-03-18T04:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	wtf, what are you trying to say?
2009-03-18T04:56:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	that file permissions are not the problem :)
2009-03-18T04:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	ok
2009-03-18T04:56:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	also, can the language, please
2009-03-19T06:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	agreed
2009-03-19T06:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	he has pmed me
2009-03-19T06:55:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	ah, ok cool
2009-03-23T01:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	you can run a native development version of what will become Chrome for Linux
2009-03-23T03:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	he is off topic see
2009-03-23T03:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	he is in wrong channel
2009-03-23T03:45:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	incorrect.
2009-03-23T03:45:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	he wants to use his ubuntu system to connect his 360 to the internet. that is not offtopic.
2009-03-23T03:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	ok I missed that bit, yep that's not off top ic
2009-03-30T04:20:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	s/he said C++
2009-03-31T19:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	that's not true
2009-03-31T19:03:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	oh?
2009-03-31T19:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	8.10 can be upgraded to 9.04 beta
2009-03-31T19:04:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	well, we should tell people how or not advocate it
2009-03-31T19:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	yep not advocate it
2009-03-31T19:04:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	:)
2009-03-31T19:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	I may start telling people to go and put 8.04 on more,  because of what I have seen so far of 9.04.  and how 8.04 is long term suppourt and  8.10 isn't
2009-03-31T19:06:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	yeah, 8.10 is geared more towards people who can handle the changes
2009-03-31T19:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	yeah  geared towards people that can handle the changes, such as myself
2009-04-12T01:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	caty and meshuggah are here to troll
2009-04-12T01:29:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	i see.
2009-04-12T01:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	really he does not even have that system, he  is here to pretend to be noob now
2009-04-12T01:46:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	that's possible, but there's no need to be insulting.
2009-04-12T01:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	no I know, because of other channel
2009-04-12T01:46:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	which one?
2009-04-12T01:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	still here?
2009-04-12T02:00:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	yo
2009-04-12T02:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	I got banned for 24  hours from the other channel, for that,  but  I am loyal to this channel :)   and  I don't really care about the other one, becasue it's stupid
2009-04-21T03:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	well you got to clean install for full Ext4 suppourt in 9.04
2009-04-21T03:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	,but can do something to Ext3 for partial
2009-04-21T03:03:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	only if I want to format the / as ext4, right?
2009-04-21T03:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	unless your going to have Ext4, probably not that much point in 9.04
2009-04-21T03:05:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	well, I'm going to get it working stable, then worry about ext4. I'm sure I can convert my / from ext3 to ext4 without having to install from the get-go :)
2009-04-21T03:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	yeah, but  it won't be 100%  full Ext4
2009-04-21T03:05:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	not if I do it my way
2009-04-21T03:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	something to do with files etc  like  the old files are Ext3, and the new files are Ext4
2009-04-21T03:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	what's your way?
2009-04-21T03:06:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	it doesn't work like that - files are files, they don't care
2009-04-21T03:06:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	make a backup, reformat, copy the files back over ;)
2009-04-21T03:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	8.04 is pretty nice, and yeah the long term suppourt release, unlike 8.10 and 9.04
2009-04-21T03:07:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	uhm, 9.04 isn't an LTS release?
2009-04-21T03:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	correct, 9.04 is not LTS
2009-04-21T03:07:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	interesting. oh well.
2009-04-21T03:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	9.04 is not that great either,  some under the hood stuff though,  it's got arm in there
2009-04-21T03:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	new version of Gnome, new default log in screen, and that's about it.
2009-04-21T03:08:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	well, it's a system that I haven't run in a long time (just put a new PSU in it yesterday) so I don't care which way it goes :)
2009-04-21T03:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	and Ext4 yeah
2009-04-21T03:09:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	I couldn't care less about gnome, as I'll be using it to compile the latest E
2009-04-21T03:31:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	this is why I'm waiting for the formal release before making any such recommendation
2009-04-21T03:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	same here
2009-04-21T03:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	and for me to do my nice clean install with Ext4 :)
2009-04-21T03:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	before I start recommending people to upgrade or not,  more properly
2009-04-21T03:32:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	sounds like a plan :)
2009-04-21T03:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	my upgrades from 8.10 to alpha6 went bad
2009-04-21T03:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	issues remained
2009-05-01T04:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	what?
2009-05-01T04:32:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	i usually do a / /usr /var /home
2009-05-01T04:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	why?
2009-05-01T04:32:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	old habit :)
2009-05-01T04:33:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	I like to know, when the system starts losing free space, where it's going
2009-05-03T22:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	xss??  what's that
2009-05-03T22:11:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	cross-site scripting
2009-05-03T22:12:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	that's what the noscript plugin for firefox is for ;)
2009-05-20T04:50:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	what? we support jaunty here
2009-05-20T04:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	he is asking about 9.10
2009-05-20T04:50:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	sorry, mis-read it as 9.04
2009-05-20T04:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	ok no problem
2009-05-20T04:50:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	been a long day :)
2009-05-20T04:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	ah ok
2009-05-21T05:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	I don't like the !ask trigger message that much
2009-05-21T05:16:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	then don't use it
2009-05-21T05:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	I use it sometimes though
2009-05-25T01:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	it's a good site, but contains some info that is not encouraged here
2009-05-25T01:33:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	perhaps it's time that something was done about it
2009-05-25T01:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	about what?   the unoffical site?   contact them and  suggest removing the bad info?  is that what you meant?
2009-05-25T01:34:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	no need there, really... anyone can register, make an account, and change it
2009-05-25T01:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	true with the domain name they have, would be much better if it was an offical site
2009-05-25T01:35:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	LjL: the name itself tends to lead many to believe that it is official. kind of like whitehouse.gov
2009-05-25T01:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	,because wikipedia can be pretty good for tech information :)
2009-05-25T01:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	I assume that's why
2009-06-23T06:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	,because it does not count as a security update?
2009-06-23T06:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	only security updates from those repos
2009-06-23T06:41:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	yeah, well, it keeps on crashing and the only known fix is 0.9.15 and the bug's already been reported
2009-06-23T06:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	well maybe there's a ppa for it
2009-09-01T08:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	you good at dealing with Grub issues?
2009-09-01T08:07:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	usually ask for the error # and google it
2009-09-01T08:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	well  he didn't advertise exactly, but he did want to do something odd as root,  and then mentions the command
2009-09-01T08:40:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	it was typed in the channel, it was therefore advertised.
2009-09-01T08:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	ah ok
2009-09-03T06:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	that  looked  interesting on my client
2009-09-03T06:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	a part of it on my client went over, one of those purple channal messages even
2009-09-03T06:43:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	normally a line gets cut off after a certain amount of buffer is consumed - this didn't seem to cut off, so it was probably a translation error due to no utf on my end (i should fix that)
2009-09-03T06:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	utf?
2009-09-03T06:44:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	language encoding
2009-09-03T06:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	ah ok
2009-09-08T04:12:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	:p
2009-09-12T01:51:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	best not to ask any further :)
2009-09-12T01:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	hmm uhmm hmm :D
2009-09-12T01:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	uh hmm I meant
2009-09-12T01:53:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	clearly it's not a personal system :)
2009-09-12T02:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	well it's the weekend, maybe that's it :D
2009-09-12T04:39:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	the filesystem is proper in wubi.
2009-09-12T04:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	Ext2 isn't it?
2009-09-12T04:39:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	uhm, what? ext3 and ext4 are ext2, you know
2009-09-12T04:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	Ext4 is better than the previous ones :)   as long as a distro has a proper kernel for it and all that
2009-09-12T04:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	actsaully even in 9.04 it's pretty good,  it's just people might get issues
2009-09-12T04:40:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	so ext3 is ext2, but ext4 is ext4 - but, ext4 has to be tuned for SSD's, it seems... that's kind of cool
2009-09-12T04:41:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	that's what the tunign is for
2009-09-12T04:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	tuned for  SSD's ??? meaning?
2009-09-12T04:41:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	see the url i pasted to kchapman
2009-09-18T06:03:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	it's not going to boot to 128MB
2009-09-18T06:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	Hardy can
2009-09-18T06:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	as long as what I just said happens
2009-09-18T06:04:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	true, but it's all old software, he might as well run a derivative that's more suitable
2009-10-03T07:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	same here
2009-10-03T07:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	I guess, and it used to be a pain
2009-11-18T02:37:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	it is if it's being shared to some windows computers
2009-11-18T02:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	uhmm?
2009-11-18T02:38:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	yeah. oh that's right, you haven't worked much with bridging linux and windows, huh
2009-11-18T02:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	I guess not,  bridgeing sounds slightly familur, but what is that?
2009-11-18T02:39:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	it's a term to describe a generalization
2010-05-10T11:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	I know you like 9.04, reminder you have untill end of October with 9.04 still being supported by security updates.
2010-05-10T11:15:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	thanks, I knew it was going to run out at some point :)
2010-05-10T11:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	indeed
2010-06-19T23:21:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	that's impossible. gnome was just a terrible implementation from the get-go, it's impossible to make it any worse. ;)
2010-06-19T23:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	What do you use?
2010-06-19T23:21:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	E17. I keep gnome around just in case, but I wouldn't bet any private information on it.
2010-06-19T23:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	woudn't bet any proviate information on it?
2010-06-19T23:22:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	yeah, I don't trust it
2010-06-24T13:41:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	hey
2010-06-24T13:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	Hey
2010-06-24T13:42:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	you any good with broadcom drivers?
2010-06-24T13:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	no
2010-06-24T13:43:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	ah ok - gotta sleep
2010-07-12T00:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	Wubi
2010-07-12T00:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	proper partitioned install is better in long run :)  and I think you know this already :)
2010-08-26T03:34:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	yeah but the 1 is still accessed by the left hand ;)
2010-08-26T03:35:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	speak for yourself.
2010-08-26T03:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	I know I went a bit off topic before when it came to weather stuff, and even put so
2010-08-26T03:36:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	you assume too much. don't.
2010-08-26T03:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	I read it wrong or something
2010-08-26T03:37:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	did you hit your head today or something?
2010-08-26T03:40:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	heh, I'm not the US gov't, so I can't put a GPS under his car ;)
2010-09-04T20:17:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	that's about as pointless as using k3b in Ubuntu
2010-09-04T20:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	no since for example in my expereince Brasero will suck at making data DVD's, but will be ok at making CD's, where as K3B will be fine for both, and realy K3B is way better than Brasero as well
2010-09-04T20:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	K3B is one of the most popular and loved K3B apps
2010-09-04T20:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	uh KDE apps at the end of that, I made a typo
2010-09-04T20:19:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	and yet, k3b uses kdelibs, not gnome or gtk libs, which kind of goes along with your whole argument for using Xchat instead of Konversation :)
2010-09-04T20:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	yes it uses QT and what not, but so what, mixing apps is good :)  and the people who make a big fuss about that, heh heh.  I think mixing apps is great, since neither desktop environment and its apps, is anywhere near perfect.
2010-09-04T20:20:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	if it's so great, why did you bother telling him that Konversation would be better than Xchat? :)
2010-09-04T20:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	since he was using Kubuntu
2010-09-04T20:21:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	my point exactly.
2010-09-04T20:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	and even if he hadn't been, I might have said something
2010-10-04T11:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	Why since he can maybe see  where you  live on it?  If he knew where that was
2010-10-04T11:27:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	like he'd be able to do anything about it
2010-10-04T11:28:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	more likely on you than me ;)
2010-10-14T15:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	Got your Ubuntu back????
2010-10-14T15:01:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	yes.
2010-10-14T15:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	re install?
2010-10-14T15:02:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	nope.
2010-10-16T02:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gnea	Unity is rather differnet to standard Gnome
2010-10-16T02:54:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	it doesn't sound like something I'd use
2010-10-16T03:01:00.000Z	Gnea	sebsebseb	easy there...
