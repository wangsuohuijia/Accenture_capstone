2010-12-18T17:53:00.000Z	soreau	kubanc	Instead, the 1400 would use the open radeon driver which has much better support using xrandr 1.2 which the nvidia driver still does not support
2010-12-18T17:54:00.000Z	kubanc	soreau	let's say enabling dual monitors, or enabling s-video... I know that twinview comes from nvidia, so i agree with you, that it won't work with ATI
2010-12-18T17:55:00.000Z	soreau	kubanc	I use S-video and dual monitors with no problems
2010-12-18T17:55:00.000Z	kubanc	soreau	what graphic card do you have?
2010-12-18T17:57:00.000Z	soreau	kubanc	rv350 (Radeon 8600)
2010-12-18T17:57:00.000Z	soreau	kubanc	rv350 (Radeon 9600)*
2010-12-18T17:57:00.000Z	soreau	kubanc	The only thing is, S-video is currently hard coded to 800x600 though Im trying to change that
2010-12-18T17:59:00.000Z	kubanc	soreau	it is working, if i wen't to system/monitors, but the only thing that i can enable is same image on LCD and TV
2010-12-18T18:00:00.000Z	soreau	kubanc	Pastebin the output of xrandr
2010-12-18T18:03:00.000Z	kubanc	soreau	xrandr for settings when i would like same image on monitor and LCD, or when i would like to extend my screen to TV?
