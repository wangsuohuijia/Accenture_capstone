2006-12-11T14:08:00.000Z	robdeman		hi all
2006-12-11T14:08:00.000Z	robdeman		could anybody help me with choosing the right partition sizes?
2006-12-11T14:09:00.000Z	robdeman		I want to do a software RAID1 (2x 120GB drives) Now I am thinking to od this /boot = 500MB, /SWAP = 1GB .. how much vor / and /var?
2006-12-11T14:09:00.000Z	robdeman		I basically do LAMP + tons of videos on thw webserver
2006-12-11T14:10:00.000Z	robdeman		so my problem is: /var = 10GB and / = the rest -- or / = 10 GB and /VAR is the rest ?
2006-12-11T14:10:00.000Z	robdeman		different wiki's say different things here
2006-12-11T14:11:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	i'd give / to the rest, since you haven't mentioned a separate /usr partition
2006-12-11T14:11:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	There is only 1 user indeed
2006-12-11T14:11:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	uh...? having or not having a separate /usr isn't quite related to the number of users
2006-12-11T14:12:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	Ok sorry Im a totally newbie
2006-12-11T14:12:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	but anyway, what you're saying is: have separate /boot and /var, and keep everything else (including /usr and /home) in a single / partition. that says to me that / is the one you want to be biggest
2006-12-11T14:13:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	Yes true. I was advised to seperate /var b/c it tends to fill up with logs right?
2006-12-11T14:13:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	fill up... well, 10Gb doesn't sound like it'd fill up that easily, imho. but then, if you're going to put tons on videos on the webserver, those are going to end up in /var/www
2006-12-11T14:14:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	but then again, i think i'd make a symbolic link to somewhere else in that case. but that's just me
2006-12-11T14:26:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	if by "volumes" you mean "partitions", there can only be 4 primary partitions on a drive. if you want more than that, you need to create an extended partition containing some logical partitions
2006-12-11T14:27:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	ok. And should I use Primary instead of Ligical when possible?
2006-12-11T14:27:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	gives less hassle, i guess.
2006-12-11T14:27:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	I mean, why would I not use Logical? is Primary better?
2006-12-11T14:28:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	bah, no, not "better"... but i use primary partitions normally. i don't think it's a very big issue
2006-12-13T09:22:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	what if you "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop"?
2006-12-13T10:50:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	i don't know
2006-12-14T17:14:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	Yes cool thanks!
2007-03-22T14:23:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	you edit /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-03-22T14:23:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	ah thanks!
2007-04-22T07:57:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	see the messages from Ubotu. you just need to enable the Universe repository (if you don't already have it enabled), and then install the version you prefer using any standard means ( sudo apt-get install otrs2 , or equivalently from Synaptic or Adept)
2007-04-22T07:58:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	I did install it, my question was more on how to get it working? there is a guide (for Debian ... http://www.debianadmin.com/how-to-install-otrs-open-source-ticket-request-system-in-debian.html ) but I dont get the configuration menu that they show there (screenshots)
2007-04-22T07:59:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	try  sudo dpkg-reconfigure otrs  (or otrs2, whatever you installed)
2007-04-22T08:01:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	this is what I keep getting (also with your suggestion: http://pastebin.ca/452733
2007-04-22T08:02:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	trying installing it
2007-04-22T08:03:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	You ar etrying it now?
2007-04-22T08:05:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	i'm installing it. right now i've got a dialog starting with "otrs2 must have a database installed and configured before it can be used.  If you like, this can be handled with dbconfig-common."
2007-04-22T08:05:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	Im not getting that dialog?
2007-04-22T08:05:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	then it asks me whether i want to use pgsql or mysql... actually does look like the debian stuff (slightly different wordings but that's all)
2007-04-22T08:06:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	right... but im not seeing any of that??
2007-04-22T08:06:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	Did you sudo apt-get install otsr2 ?
2007-04-22T08:06:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	well i don't know why that is, let's try to find out. note that i'm not running Server. yes, that's what i did.
2007-04-22T08:07:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	me too.. ok im on Server but... that shouldnt really matter right
2007-04-22T08:07:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	I also dont see any directives in my apache.conf being made that point to otrs etc.
2007-04-22T08:07:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	I would expect the installer do do this right?
2007-04-22T08:08:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	not sure about that, right now it failed because i don't have pgsql or mysql installed - installing
2007-04-22T08:08:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	yes, it does seem to be setting up stuff in the apache2 directory
2007-04-22T08:09:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	and i also get all the chown/etc stuff like you pasted... except that before that, i also get the dialogs
2007-04-22T08:09:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	strange --- im not getting just that dialog bog
2007-04-22T08:11:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	try  sudo apt-get --reinstall install otrs2 , and give me the output of it all
2007-04-22T08:12:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	http://pastebin.ca/452747
2007-04-22T08:14:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	dunno, try  dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low xserver-xorg , although i believe low should be the default priority... maybe it's different on Server?
2007-04-22T08:15:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	bwah, xserver-xorg --- no, of course i meant  sudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low otrs2 , sorry :)
2007-04-22T08:15:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	Ok haha
2007-04-22T08:16:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	Maybe my repositories are wrong?
2007-04-22T08:16:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	i doubt it. i mean, maybe they are, but that would have little to do with this problem
2007-04-22T08:18:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	the dpkg-reconfigure with priority=low still isn't working, anyway?  you could try  sudo apt-get --purge autoremove otrs2  (but *pay attention* to what it asks you to remove!), and then reinstall it. in case it was a glitch of some sort.
2007-04-22T08:21:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	I did everything you suugested -- auto remove, reinstall, reconfigure priority low.. etc.. still the same problem
2007-04-22T08:44:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:iumDLueJAOcJ:www.mail-archive.com/otrs%40otrs.org/msg17156.html+OTRS+Ubuntu&hl=nl&ct=clnk&cd=3&gl=nl&client=firefox-a
2007-04-22T08:46:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	the guy's on Server as well, while i'm not, that has to mean something... what, i wonder :)
2007-04-22T08:46:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	yes exactly.. but mmm what? :)
2007-04-22T08:49:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/otrs2/+bug/105860 - and also https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/otrs2/+bug/90987 is probably related (in that it's failing because the wrong answers are given as default, and no dialogs are even shown...). i think you should go and confirm the former report; link also to that page you gave me now
2007-04-22T08:52:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	I commneted this one https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/otrs2/+bug/105860
2007-04-22T08:53:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	wait though, weren't you on Feisty yourself? 7.04
2007-04-22T08:53:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	nope
2007-04-22T08:54:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	Im on Ubuntu 6.10 - Server
2007-04-22T08:54:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	(anyway don't just comment, actually mark the bug as confirmed). oh i was somehow convinced that you were. then i guess i suppose it might also be because i'm on Feisty, rather than just because i'm not on Server
2007-04-22T08:55:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	Ok I confirmed it
2007-04-22T08:58:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	well, i confirmed it too now :P anyway, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/otrs2/+bug/105860
2007-04-22T09:01:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	meanwhile anyway, perhaps --purge uninstall it and try to see if the older version available, otrs (1.3.something) works any better?
2007-04-22T09:02:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	I tried that sudo apt-get install otrs --> same problem also no config menu...
2007-04-22T09:03:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	maybe upgrade to feisty then
2007-04-22T09:03:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	no thanks... haha
2007-04-22T09:03:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	I am afraid of upgrading my carefully configured 6.10 server
2007-04-22T09:04:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	Its too new for a production server to my taste..
2007-04-22T09:04:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	well, you have a point, though if you wanted something to keep long term, you might as well used dapper ;)
2007-04-22T09:04:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	anyway, now i'm away for a couple of minutes, but i'll try diffing the edgy package with the feisty one and see if i can pick up the difference that makes the config not show...
2007-04-22T09:20:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	uhm, the feisty package's postinst and postrm is very different from the edgy one
2007-04-22T09:21:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	erhm not sure what that means?
2007-04-22T09:21:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	it means the configuration stuff is totally different in the Feisty package
2007-04-22T09:21:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	there's not just one difference or two that may account for your problem... they're just 100% different
2007-04-22T09:21:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	well but I wasnt installing the Feisty one right
2007-04-22T09:22:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	no, but i was comparing the Edgy package (which apparently doesn't work) with the Feisty package (which works for me) to find out what may be the culprit
2007-04-22T09:22:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	aaha ok
2007-04-22T09:43:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	hey I have otrs2 working... manually editted the httpd conf
2007-04-22T11:01:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	sudo -i -u otsr
2007-04-22T11:01:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	where otrs is the username
2007-04-22T11:03:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	thanks... mm it says 'sudo: no passwd entry for otsr!'
2007-04-22T11:05:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	you think its normal that 'otsr' user ha sno paswd at all?
2007-06-01T09:28:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	i don't think ext3 has a limitation on how many files you can put in a single directory, though it has a (settable) limitation on total files
2008-01-09T19:23:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	look at the logs...
2008-01-09T19:24:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	ehrm how do I look at them?
2008-01-09T19:24:00.000Z	LjL	robdeman	it's the files in /var/log, check messages and syslog for starters
2008-01-09T19:26:00.000Z	robdeman	LjL	ok
