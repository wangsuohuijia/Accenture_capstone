2010-10-10T09:33:00.000Z	Furi		textboxes are no longer allowing input; how can i change the settings without input?
2010-10-10T09:35:00.000Z	Furi		it's X dependant
2010-10-10T09:35:00.000Z	Furi		is there a way to open a terminal window without a panel?
2010-10-10T09:37:00.000Z	Furi		terminal doesn't accept input, either
2010-10-10T09:39:00.000Z	Furi		is there a way to start a window manager without using the terminal, because nothing is taking keyboard input except for the fallback terminal?
