2012-06-04T06:24:00.000Z	sambagirl		i've been trying to install some packages i need via the ubuntu software center however I have been getting this Requires installation of untrusted packages.  The action would require the installation of packages from not authenticated sources.
2012-06-04T06:25:00.000Z	cpet	sambagirl	choose yes and continue
2012-06-04T06:26:00.000Z	sambagirl	cpet	I dont have an option for yes, just a details dropdown and there isnt anything there but the application name
2012-06-04T06:26:00.000Z	cpet	sambagirl	are you using the gui or cli?
2012-06-04T06:27:00.000Z	sambagirl	cpet	the gui

2012-06-04T06:35:00.000Z	sambagirl	cpet	just a sec,  i am looking on the website to see how to do it from the shell. they have steps there.

2012-06-04T06:36:00.000Z	cpet	sambagirl	i need errors or something
2012-06-04T06:40:00.000Z	sambagirl	cpet	i dont have any errors. i tried the steps in the shell on this place http://abisource.com/wiki/Install_on_Ubuntu  however i noticed in the bottom that it says that it looks like it has stopped being supported by ubuntu or for ubuntu?
2012-06-04T06:41:00.000Z	cpet	sambagirl	open up a terminal and type sudo apt-get install abiword
2012-06-04T06:41:00.000Z	cpet	sambagirl	see if it gives you an error
2012-06-04T06:42:00.000Z	sambagirl	cpet	haha that's funny
