2010-10-13T11:05:00.000Z	Fritzy		help -- can't get passed "Bootloader install failed" dialog in install.. can't even cancel installation.
2010-10-13T11:06:00.000Z	Fritzy		How do I pull up a shell during install?
2010-10-13T11:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fritzy	There should be a drop down area for looking at detailed error messages.
2010-10-13T11:08:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	Not that I can see. "How would you like to proceed?" followed by the options of choosing a different device, continuing, or cancelling. Selecting any of these options and hitting ok does not close the dialog and doesn't appear to do anything other than depressing the OK button.
2010-10-13T11:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fritzy	How comfortable are you with the terminal?
2010-10-13T11:08:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	quite comfortable
2010-10-13T11:09:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	not sure how to open a terminal from this view though.  :)
2010-10-13T11:09:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	else I'd run grub-install myself
2010-10-13T11:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fritzy	Ok, then press ctrl+alt+F1 to get to a terminal (ctrl+alt+F7 to get back to X) then run "DISPLAY=:0.0 gnome-terminal" to start a terminal within X. From there please use gnome-screenshot to create a screenshot.
2010-10-13T11:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fritzy	It sounds like you can probably trick the installer into thinking it installed grub successfully by making /usr/bin/grub-install a symlink to /bin/true, but I'd like to see the exact error/dialog first.
2010-10-13T11:12:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	ok, let me get this uploaded somewhere
2010-10-13T11:15:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	http://play.brokt.com/~fritzy/images/ubuntu-install-fail.png
2010-10-13T11:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fritzy	Can you continue with the "continue without bootloader" option?
2010-10-13T11:18:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	no, regardless of which of the 3 radio options I select, when I click Ok or hit enter or anything else, the button depresses, but the dialog stays up
2010-10-13T11:20:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	I can't get past the dialog. :S  grub-install generally errors out with "grub-probe error: cannot find a device for /boot/grub (is /dev/ mounted?)
2010-10-13T11:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fritzy	You need to "sudp chroot /target" first.
2010-10-13T11:22:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	/target is empty.... sudo chroot fails with "/bin/bash : No such file ..."
2010-10-13T11:24:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	mounted it... trying now
2010-10-13T11:26:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	now that I did sudo mount /dev/sda1 /target && sudo chroot /target ... my /dev/ seems incomplete.. and grub-install still cannot find a device
2010-10-13T11:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fritzy	You need to bind mount /dev/ /proc/ and /sys/ into the chroot first.
2010-10-13T11:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fritzy	sudo mount -o bind /sys/ /target/sys; sudo mount -o bind /dev/ /target/dev/; sudo mount -o /proc /targed/proc
2010-10-13T11:27:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	cool, now I have grub installed on /dev/sda how do I continue past the locked dialog?
2010-10-13T11:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fritzy	Try adding "echo grub-install has been temporarily disabled, FIX THIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE; exit 0" as the second line of /usr/sbin/grub-install
2010-10-13T11:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fritzy	Then hopefully the installer will think grub-install ran successfully, as it will just exit with success.
2010-10-13T11:32:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	no dice.. tried within chroot and outside of it. :S
2010-10-13T11:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fritzy	And before you reboot, make sure you run "update-grub" within the chroot.
2010-10-13T11:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fritzy	Tried what exactly? Modifying the script or update-grub?
2010-10-13T11:40:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	modifying grub-install in chroot and outside
2010-10-13T11:40:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	to echo and exit 0 as you said
2010-10-13T11:40:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	doesn't help me get passed the dialog
2010-10-13T11:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fritzy	Try doing the same with /usr/sbin/update-grub.
2010-10-13T11:41:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	in chroot or out?
2010-10-13T11:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fritzy	In.
2010-10-13T11:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fritzy	And confirm that it worked with "grub-install; echo $?" and "update-grub; echo $?" (should print the message then "0" for successfull completion).
2010-10-13T11:43:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	both echo the message and then echo's 0 within chroot /target
2010-10-13T11:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fritzy	Can you continue now?
2010-10-13T11:44:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	no, the button depresses, but nothing else changes
2010-10-13T11:47:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	confusing me with kevin_? I can't close the window either... no reaction.
2010-10-13T11:47:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	I can go to the right-click menu and close
2010-10-13T11:47:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	but that doesn't do anything either
2010-10-13T11:49:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	sorry to make you juggle.. if I reboot, I imagine it'll boot to an uncompleted install. Is there some way I can finish the install?
2010-10-13T11:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fritzy	You may just have to use the alternate install CD, or "sudo pkill dpkg" and hope the install then completes in a usefull state ( I doubt it will ).
2010-10-13T11:49:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	ok
2010-10-13T11:49:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	thanks for your help.  :)
2010-10-13T11:49:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	have a good one
2010-10-13T11:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fritzy	You're welcome.
2010-10-13T12:02:00.000Z	Fritzy	Jordan_U	my first boot involved manually specifying the kernel (then running fixing and running grub-update after boot) and remarking out the cdrom line in /etc/apt/sources.list ... other than that seems fine so far.  :)
