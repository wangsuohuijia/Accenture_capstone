2012-10-22T00:44:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	is the USB hooked to the computer you want to use via wifi?
2012-10-22T00:45:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	its better to try one config at a time
2012-10-22T00:46:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	now from the wifi computer you see in printer properties the IP address

2012-10-22T00:50:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	you could try setting up the printer via webbrowser and use cups
2012-10-22T00:51:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	basically you open your browser and in the address type "localhost" and it should bring up the cups webpage
2012-10-22T00:52:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	from there you can add the printer
2012-10-22T00:53:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	does the printer even make any sounds?
2012-10-22T00:54:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	can you see the print que?  Sometimes they need to be cleaned out of failed jobs
2012-10-22T00:56:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	that is really weird
2012-10-22T00:56:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	how about turning it off for 5 seconds and then back on

2012-10-22T01:02:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	did you use this driver?  c2espinstaller.sh
2012-10-22T01:04:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	try installing with a C310 driver
2012-10-22T01:05:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	c2espinstaller.sh is more automatic, just choose C310
2012-10-22T01:07:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	you will want to delete the printer from your previous attempts on each computer
2012-10-22T01:07:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	then try the linked one
2012-10-22T01:09:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	if you download c2espinstaller.sh, right click it, then properties and make it executible
2012-10-22T01:10:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	are you finding the driver?
2012-10-22T01:20:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	still updating?
2012-10-22T01:22:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	I gotta go for a while, but will check back in about an hour and a half
2012-10-22T01:28:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	you could not use the 2cespinstaller.sh ?
2012-10-22T01:30:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	you have to make the .sh file executible
2012-10-22T01:30:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	find it via your file manager, right click on it and choose properties, make executible
2012-10-22T01:32:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	its right click, properties, permissions
2012-10-22T01:34:00.000Z	mdg2	yourfriendisaaac	find the c2espinstalle.sh file via your file manager, right click, choose Properties, then Permissions and make executible, then you can double click its name and it will run
