2009-09-02T22:42:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	the key ring keeps your passwords for you, it opens automatically when you log in, but not if you have "auto login" set, you could try just prssing <enter> in that dialog though
2009-09-02T22:47:00.000Z	cmp	guntbert	iam sorry i lost my connection
2009-09-02T22:48:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	the key ring keeps your passwords for you, it opens automatically when you log in, but not if you have "auto login" set, you could try just prssing <enter> in that dialog though

2009-09-02T22:49:00.000Z	cmp	guntbert	i want to cancel this keyring
2009-09-02T22:49:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	do you have autologin set?
2009-09-02T22:50:00.000Z	cmp	guntbert	yes
2009-09-02T22:51:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	ok, try to log out and immediately log in again but with your name and password - that could open the key ring
2009-09-02T22:52:00.000Z	cmp	guntbert	i dont know how to open the keyring - iam very new in linux - but i can follow you step by step
2009-09-02T22:53:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	so log out - log in (but *not* automatically)
2009-09-02T22:54:00.000Z	cmp	guntbert	when i log out i recive window ( inter your username - and password )
2009-09-02T22:54:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	yes, do that please
2009-09-02T22:55:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	are you back in your session?
2009-09-02T22:55:00.000Z	cmp	guntbert	- yes  iam doing it
2009-09-02T22:58:00.000Z	cmp	guntbert	, i did and iam back
2009-09-02T22:59:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	and now go to system/preferences/encryption and... - does it show any keys?
2009-09-02T23:03:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	sorry, I have to leave for some time,
2009-09-02T23:07:00.000Z	cmp	guntbert	ok i opened it
2009-09-02T23:07:00.000Z	cmp	guntbert	just tell me what to do after i opened it
2009-09-02T23:27:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	I'm back - did you get your problem sorted?
2009-09-02T23:27:00.000Z	cmp	guntbert	not yet
2009-09-02T23:27:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	ok, did you open the key ring manager?
2009-09-02T23:27:00.000Z	cmp	guntbert	mind if PM ?
2009-09-02T23:28:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	please keep it in the channel
2009-09-02T23:28:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	especially the first sentence from ubottu is important
2009-09-02T23:30:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	yes, thats what we are trying to do, so did you open the key ring manager?
2009-09-02T23:31:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	good. now look at the tab passwords
2009-09-02T23:31:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	there is a line passwords:login
2009-09-02T23:32:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	right click on that line, select "change password"
2009-09-02T23:36:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	in that dialog type your user password in the first line and leave the other two lines empty - so the keyring has no password from now on (its a security risk, but if you only store your password for mobile...)
2009-09-02T23:40:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	did you set "no password" for the key ring?
2009-09-02T23:42:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	strange, but now you should be able to just press <enter> and get along
2009-09-02T23:49:00.000Z	cmp	guntbert	- here is the link - and you will see the window which appears to me http://imagebin.org/62196
2009-09-02T23:51:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	ah *that* is the password/PIN you have to give so that vodafone accepts you - you should have got that that from vodafone
2009-09-02T23:52:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	and probably the key ring will store that for you, so yo will have to enter it only once
2009-09-02T23:53:00.000Z	cmp	guntbert	- have you got the pic?
2009-09-02T23:54:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	yes, and I answered already some minutes ago :-)
2009-09-02T23:57:00.000Z	cmp	guntbert	i called Vodafone already and they answered me - NO PASS WORD needed  :(
2009-09-02T23:58:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	what happens when you just press <enter>?
2009-09-02T23:59:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	sorry, the I don't know - please ask the channel again
2010-02-17T17:50:00.000Z	guntbert	cmp	cool down please
2010-02-17T17:50:00.000Z	cmp	guntbert	iam really cool
