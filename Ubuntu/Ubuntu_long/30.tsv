2007-08-28T07:24:00.000Z	rafaelscj	Pelo	I don't want to use sudo every time I want to write on /dev/sda3
2007-08-28T07:25:00.000Z	Pelo	rafaelscj	 don'T give write acces to fstab , give it to the /dev/sda3 mountpoint
2007-08-28T07:26:00.000Z	rafaelscj	Pelo	can you tell me the chmod's parameters?
2007-08-28T07:26:00.000Z	Pelo	rafaelscj	 what is the mount point for /dev/sda3 ?
2007-08-28T07:27:00.000Z	rafaelscj	Pelo	/media/sda3
2007-08-28T07:27:00.000Z	Pelo	rafaelscj	 what FS is it ?
2007-08-28T07:27:00.000Z	rafaelscj	Pelo	reiserFS
2007-08-28T07:29:00.000Z	Pelo	rafaelscj	  in the terminal  type  sudo gedit /etc/fstab   ,  copy and save this line  /dev/sda3 /media/sda3 reiserfs defaults 0 2        save and restart

2007-08-28T07:33:00.000Z	rafaelscj	Pelo	this is my fstab -> :UUID=8b6a5cae-46e3-41a7-a5ec-50e26524fd2a /media/sda3     reiserfs defaults        0       2
2007-08-28T07:34:00.000Z	Pelo	rafaelscj	 this is how it is now ? and you can't write to it ?
2007-08-28T07:35:00.000Z	rafaelscj	Pelo	there is no -> File > New folder
2007-08-28T07:35:00.000Z	Pelo	rafaelscj	   look into  /media , so you see a  /sda3 in there ?
2007-08-28T07:38:00.000Z	rafaelscj	Pelo	yes, there is. I think that the device is /dev/hda3 instead of /dev/sda3 but it was the auto-detection (/dev/sda3)
2007-08-28T07:38:00.000Z	rafaelscj	Pelo	I'm not sure
2007-08-28T07:39:00.000Z	Pelo	rafaelscj	  terminal    blkid   see what is it listed as   /hda or sda ,
2007-08-28T07:41:00.000Z	rafaelscj	Pelo	sda, there was a advanced option (during installation) that sad "install grub on hda"
2007-08-28T07:41:00.000Z	Pelo	rafaelscj	 not hda   grub idenfifies it,s hdd diffrently,  don'T worry about that
2007-08-28T07:42:00.000Z	Pelo	rafaelscj	are you the one that made the entry for your /dev/sda3 manualy in fstab or was it made automaticaly when you instaled ?
2007-08-28T07:43:00.000Z	rafaelscj	Pelo	I created 3 partitions during installastion
2007-08-28T07:44:00.000Z	Pelo	rafaelscj	 ok,  rafaelscj , just to review here ,  your problem is that you can't make folders and files in /media/sda3 ?
