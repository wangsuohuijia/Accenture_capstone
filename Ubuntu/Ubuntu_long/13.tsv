2007-08-07T16:35:00.000Z	wers		what packages do i install to enable mp3 burning in K3b?
2007-08-07T05:36:00.000Z	wers		what's the kget alternative for gnome?
2007-08-07T05:36:00.000Z	wers		by kget, i mean, the file downloader
2007-08-07T05:37:00.000Z	soundray	wers	gwget perhaps
2007-11-23T05:01:00.000Z	soundray	wers	I don't think it's possible to open psw files in any native Linux program
2007-11-23T05:02:00.000Z	wers	soundray	you mean, I need windows? :((
2007-11-23T05:02:00.000Z	soundray	wers	either that, or wine
2007-11-23T05:03:00.000Z	soundray	wers	don't know, MS Works possibly
2007-11-23T05:10:00.000Z	soundray	wers	I have a PocketPC too. I've given up on trying to import psw.
2007-11-23T05:12:00.000Z	soundray	wers	it claims it can save in that format. It doesn't mention anything about opening files.
2007-11-23T05:13:00.000Z	wers	soundray	:( I really need an app that will run on wine
2007-11-23T05:13:00.000Z	wers	soundray	can a pocket pc save using another file type?
2007-11-23T05:14:00.000Z	soundray	wers	install an editor that can save as .txt (there are free programs around). Then you can copy and paste your notes and save them as plain text.
2007-11-30T04:43:00.000Z	soundray	wers	'sudo apt-get clean' does it for you
2007-11-30T04:43:00.000Z	soundray	wers	'sudo apt-get autoclean' removes all outdated debs from that directory
2008-03-15T06:17:00.000Z	soundray	wers	you can do it on the commandline with imagemagick
2008-03-15T06:18:00.000Z	soundray	wers	what do you find difficult about the crop tool in gimp?
2008-04-04T17:52:00.000Z	soundray	wers	Format-Character-Position-Subscript
2008-04-04T17:54:00.000Z	wers	soundray	thank you so much. is there any shortcut? :)
2008-04-04T17:56:00.000Z	soundray	wers	you can go through Tools-Customize-Toolbars and add a button to the Formatting toolbar
2008-04-04T17:58:00.000Z	soundray	wers	you have to highlight text you've typed already, then click the button
2008-04-04T17:59:00.000Z	soundray	wers	I'm sure you can also bind a shortcut key to a macro, but it's probably better to join an OpenOffice channel and ask there for help with that
2008-04-06T22:21:00.000Z	soundray	wers	some source packages offer a 'make uninstall' command. Run it with sudo. Failing that, go through the Makefile and undo all the changes that are listed under "install:" by hand
2008-05-22T15:48:00.000Z	soundray	wers	it creates an entry in System-Preferences
2008-06-06T03:13:00.000Z	soundray	wers	it's hard to know, not having seen the dialog box...
2008-06-06T03:14:00.000Z	wers	soundray	i'm quite confident that it's the modules. do modules usually have deb confs like that?
2008-06-06T03:14:00.000Z	soundray	wers	no
2008-06-06T03:15:00.000Z	soundray	wers	yes, you'd have to know what you want to reconfigure, though
2008-06-06T03:16:00.000Z	soundray	wers	what's the output from 'grep ^title /boot/grub/menu.lst | head -n 1'?
2008-06-06T03:20:00.000Z	soundray	wers	try 'sudo update-grub' then, and if that fails, 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-2.6.24-18-generic' (assuming that this is the kernel you want)
2008-06-06T03:26:00.000Z	wers	soundray	this is weird. sudo update-grub detected the latest kernel but it didnt show the kernel in my menu.lst. ran dpkg-reconfigure for the latest kernel but it still doesnt show in my menu.lst
2008-06-06T03:27:00.000Z	soundray	wers	yes, you can
2008-06-06T03:28:00.000Z	soundray	wers	add a title section before the line "DEBIAN AUTOMAGIC KERNEL LIST"
2008-06-06T03:28:00.000Z	soundray	wers	but here's another thing to try before you do:
2008-06-06T03:28:00.000Z	soundray	wers	'sudo apt-get --reinstall install linux-image-2.6.24-18-generic'
2008-06-06T03:30:00.000Z	wers	soundray	that sounds good to me for me to see if it will show the deb conf
2008-06-06T03:32:00.000Z	wers	soundray	didnt show the debconf. i'm going to check my menu.lst now
2008-06-06T03:32:00.000Z	wers	soundray	still didnt appear
2008-06-06T03:34:00.000Z	wers	soundray	http://paste.ubuntu.com/17335/
2008-06-21T04:37:00.000Z	soundray	wers	'apt-get autoclean' as a first step
2008-06-21T04:37:00.000Z	soundray	wers	 then run 'du -x / | sort -n' to find out what's taking up space. Removing old kernel packages is a good idea.
2008-06-21T04:38:00.000Z	wers	soundray	what does autoclean do? remove my apt archives?
2008-06-21T04:39:00.000Z	soundray	wers	only those of outdated versions
2008-06-21T04:44:00.000Z	wers	soundray	autocleane did not free some space according to my file manager though i saw that it deleted some files
2008-06-21T04:45:00.000Z	soundray	wers	you've run into the reserve. Ubuntu will show 100% as long as your disk usage is above (real) 95%.
2008-06-21T04:45:00.000Z	soundray	wers	have you got lots of old kernels?
2008-06-21T04:45:00.000Z	wers	soundray	niice. I have those old kernels. how do I delete 'em? :D
2008-06-21T04:46:00.000Z	soundray	wers	'sudo apt-get --purge remove linux-image-2.6.24-16' (as an example)
2008-06-21T04:46:00.000Z	soundray	wers	when you're done, run 'sudo apt-get autoremove' as well
2008-06-21T04:47:00.000Z	wers	soundray	is there a code that will show me the installed kernels?
2008-06-21T04:47:00.000Z	soundray	wers	dpkg -l linux-image-2*
2008-06-21T04:48:00.000Z	soundray	wers	the -l is for list
2008-06-21T04:49:00.000Z	wers	soundray	coooool :)
2008-06-21T05:33:00.000Z	wers	soundray	what do I run again after purging the old kernels?
2008-06-21T05:33:00.000Z	soundray	wers	apt-get autoremove
2008-06-21T05:34:00.000Z	wers	soundray	it didnt remove anything. oh well. i guess, it's finee
2008-06-21T05:35:00.000Z	soundray	wers	it doesn't on every system
2008-06-21T05:35:00.000Z	wers	soundray	thanks
2008-09-06T21:54:00.000Z	soundray	wers	'scp file user@destination:/target/directory/'
