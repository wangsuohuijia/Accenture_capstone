2005-11-02T14:39:00.000Z	taotime		okay installed xmms now how to play internet radio station
2005-11-02T14:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	easy and nice way - install streamtuner
2005-11-02T14:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	under Edit Preferences in streamtuner, see if xmms is the default player
2005-11-02T14:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	in streamtuner, when you click "Tune in" you should get xmms by default I think
2005-11-02T14:51:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	let me try just give me a sec  dont go away
2005-11-02T14:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	heh - I'll be here for a while :)
2005-11-02T15:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	ah actually you don't - I just noticed mine runs fine with alsa output plugin
2005-11-02T14:54:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	:  says i have to make sure i have to check about sound card, no audio, etc. i have no audio on this computer for two weeks.
2005-11-02T14:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	oh so it's a sound issue ?
2005-11-02T14:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	you never had sound on this install ?
2005-11-02T14:55:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	: man i can listen to music cd and the opening and closing music which ubuntu plays
2005-11-02T14:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	under system- preferences - multimedia systems selector, seeif you have esd as sink and oss as source
2005-11-02T14:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	and if you are getting system sounds but not others, I suggest you turn off system sounds and log back in
2005-11-02T14:57:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	: i have alsa as sink and oss as source
2005-11-02T14:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	try changing sink to esd - is this breezy?
2005-11-02T14:58:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	yes the latest one they had i downloaded and installed about 2 weeks ago.
2005-11-02T14:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	OK try esd sink and test
2005-11-02T14:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	works here
2005-11-02T14:59:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	works as esd and also worked as alsa before
2005-11-02T14:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	but if esd sink works it might solve our problem
2005-11-02T14:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	try it out
2005-11-02T15:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	in which case you need the output plugin for xmms set to esound of course
2005-11-02T15:01:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	how do i change xmms to direct to esound
2005-11-02T15:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	under options- preferences, output plugin
2005-11-02T15:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	you might need to try various options out
2005-11-02T15:04:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	i have tried that and works thanxs a bunch i m trying to show it to my wife that you can listen to radio on linux. anyways. i don't understand it all, can you like write me down two or three lines of manual.. like ok whas alsa, what is esd. ofcourse i don't want to know the whole thing, i want to know why this works now and not for two weeks
2005-11-02T15:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	basically breezy works with a thing called "dmix" which can use esound happily
2005-11-02T15:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	I don't know enough to give you a full explanation :)
2005-11-02T15:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	esd is a "sound server"
2005-11-02T15:12:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	check this out for me por fabor ; www.raaga.com click hindi click anything select all songs and see if you can listen to them
2005-11-02T15:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	umm - I have a stream playing and I'm on dialup :)
2005-11-02T15:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	checking the URL -hang on :)
2005-11-02T15:13:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	:  i know bro, i lived with dialup for about 11 years, i appreciate in a texas manner what you are doing for me.
2005-11-02T15:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	erm, thay seem tohab=ve some kind of "built-in" player
2005-11-02T15:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	I have no idea what sort of stream that would be
2005-11-02T15:17:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	: first of all i appreciate what you did for me.
2005-11-02T15:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	bleh - that site is full of ads and spam :(
2005-11-02T15:19:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	i don't know what but if i play it on windows ( dont' tell nobody around here i touch windows) it starts a small window and says, checking for media player and then asks me to choose between windows media player and real player i choose one of them, and it starts working. i know why but i don't know how of doing it in linux, and i want to show my wife it can be done in linux.
2005-11-02T15:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	you might need to install realplayer then
2005-11-02T15:20:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	:  has to be it is the only thing from my country that has some decent selection of free music so they punish you with spam and popus and stuff like that.
2005-11-02T15:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	google real player for linux
2005-11-02T15:20:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	i installed real player about two weeks ago, right after i installed ubuntu on my laptop.... but i can't get it to work, as in with that website.
2005-11-02T15:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	I have realplayer working OK here - I need it to listen to the BBC
2005-11-02T15:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	well, that site is doing something weird with its "player" - it might have issues with th elinux version, I don't know
2005-11-02T15:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	mine works fine with the BBC "player" but just hangs on your site
2005-11-02T15:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	does realplay work for you on BBC streams?
2005-11-02T15:23:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	 that's coool, i might send the site administrator a terse email asking for help....  but in the mean while, you know how to get streamripper running with streamtuner since i have streamtuner, xmms, and rhythmbox, not to mention totem
2005-11-02T15:23:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	let me check about that bbc stuff
2005-11-02T15:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	if you installed streamripper, you can just click "record" in streamtuner
2005-11-02T15:24:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	: streamtuner has pre installed radio stations. how about i want to go to some xyz-website-.com and listen to their tunes and download
2005-11-02T15:25:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	can i just do it any website or is it limited to live365 etc.
2005-11-02T15:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	then you need to get the m3u or pls file, and load the right url in streamripper
2005-11-02T15:25:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	:  any direct way of doing it like click and play
2005-11-02T15:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	normally firefox pops up a dialogue box that asks what you want to do with the stream - you can choose for instance totem or beep or xmms etc
2005-11-02T15:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	if that works you can set "dp this every time"
2005-11-02T15:27:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	:  what if if dosen't how to make it change, like i said, i just opens totem, and looks at me like a drooling child who has no clue about who broke the bottle
2005-11-02T15:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	heh - umm - ifthe format is compatible, it should play
2005-11-02T15:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	taotime	you have mp3 support and win 32 codecs installed?
2005-11-02T15:29:00.000Z	taotime	thoreauputic	: dont't know how do i check it
