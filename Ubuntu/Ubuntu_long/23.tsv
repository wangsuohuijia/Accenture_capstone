2007-09-11T12:04:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		got a quick question
2007-09-11T12:04:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		is there a way to run a program and if it crashes have it reopen?
2007-09-11T12:04:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		I have a server i run from wine
2007-09-11T12:04:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		id like it to reopen if it scrashes
2007-09-11T12:06:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		I'm running a server from thru wine and I would like it to reopen if it crashes is there a way to do that?
2007-09-11T12:06:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	well you could make yourself a script that does: while /bin/true; do wine server.exe; done so it just launches forever if it exits :)
2007-09-11T12:06:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		i have a start script to start it
2007-09-11T12:06:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		not sure what u mean
2007-09-11T12:06:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	great. so put my `whiel` loop in there
2007-09-11T12:07:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		will it keep opening new ones?
2007-09-11T12:07:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	not unless you put a & after the wine launch cmd
2007-09-11T12:07:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		oh ok where should I put that line?
2007-09-11T12:07:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	well since you've already got a script launching it, try replacing the part that launches wine with that
2007-09-11T12:08:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		so jsut replace wine server.exe with while /bin/true; do wine server.exe; ?
2007-09-11T12:09:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	so just replace wine server.exe with while /bin/true; do wine server.exe; ?
2007-09-11T12:11:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	so just replace wine server.exe with while /bin/true; do wine server.exe; ?
2007-09-11T12:12:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		ouch
2007-09-11T12:19:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	you still with us?
2007-09-11T12:21:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		I'm running a server from thru wine and I would like it to reopen if it crashes is there a way to do that?
2007-09-11T12:24:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	yeah except after wine server.exe put "; done" so: while /bin/true; do wine server.exe; done .. but I'm just guessing ;)
2007-09-11T12:24:00.000Z	dfletcher		(sorry @ work, got called away)
2007-09-11T12:25:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		so actually put done
2007-09-11T12:25:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	that's what ends a "while ... do" loop, yeah
2007-09-11T12:25:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		cuz i tried while /bin/true; do wine server.exe; and nothing opens
2007-09-11T12:26:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		so i have to write ; done
2007-09-11T12:26:00.000Z	dfletcher		yes Ninesvnsicks
2007-09-11T12:26:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		ok
2007-09-11T12:27:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		well it opened
2007-09-11T12:27:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		so if i jsut right click and close
2007-09-11T12:27:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		it should reopen right?
2007-09-11T12:27:00.000Z	dfletcher		yes
2007-09-11T12:27:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		what if i actually want to close it lol
2007-09-11T12:27:00.000Z	dfletcher		the real wtf here is that you're running a windows server on linux ;P
2007-09-11T12:27:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		lol yeah
2007-09-11T12:27:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		isnt it great
2007-09-11T12:27:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		btw it reopend your a genius
2007-09-11T12:27:00.000Z	dfletcher		lol
2007-09-11T12:28:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	you might be able to kill -SIGKILL the script to stop it
2007-09-11T12:28:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		man when the unreal community hears i have a userver for linux
2007-09-11T12:28:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		hmm
2007-09-11T12:29:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		i've recently installed linux again so im a little rusty not sure how to do that
2007-09-11T12:29:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	well try `ps -A | grep [nameofscript] ` and see if something comes out
2007-09-11T12:31:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	um the name of the script is userver(copy) cuz I was testing it
2007-09-11T12:31:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	it doesent liek the ()
2007-09-11T12:31:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	well ps -A | grep userver should be enough
2007-09-11T12:31:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		oh
2007-09-11T12:31:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		nope still reopens
2007-09-11T12:32:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	well that won't kill it
2007-09-11T12:32:00.000Z	dfletcher		does it give you a process ID thought Ninesvnsicks ?
2007-09-11T12:32:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		no
2007-09-11T12:32:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		jsut nothing
2007-09-11T12:32:00.000Z	dfletcher		hmm
2007-09-11T12:32:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		hmm
2007-09-11T12:32:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		what about
2007-09-11T12:33:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	making it open a terminal and if u close the terminal it kills the script?
2007-09-11T12:33:00.000Z	dfletcher		maybe ubuntu has some kind of task manager thing. hmm yeah that may work Ninesvnsicks
2007-09-11T12:33:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		theres system monitor
2007-09-11T12:33:00.000Z	dfletcher		can you kill processes from there? try it
2007-09-11T12:34:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		i can
2007-09-11T12:34:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		and did
2007-09-11T12:34:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		id like to make this for the public
2007-09-11T12:35:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	would there be a way to open it in the terminal with a msg saying server started and if u close the terminal it kills the script?
2007-09-11T12:35:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	you haven't been launching it in a terminal already? so how? double click?
2007-09-11T12:35:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		oh
2007-09-11T12:36:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		yeah i clicked and opened
2007-09-11T12:36:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		same thing right?
2007-09-11T12:36:00.000Z	dfletcher		but Ninesvnsicks yeah that should work... just cd to the directory holding the script and then ./userver\(copy\) or ./userver if you name it back
2007-09-11T12:36:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		oh and then if i close the terminal it kills it?
2007-09-11T12:37:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	should do. or even ctrl-c
2007-09-11T12:37:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		hmm let me try running it from terminal
2007-09-11T12:38:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		hmm
2007-09-11T12:38:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	never noticed this before it says: fixme:process:getprocessworkingsize (bunch of numbers): stub
2007-09-11T12:39:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	sounds like a wine warning. I just ignore them :)
2007-09-11T12:39:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	fixme:winsock:ntstatustowsaerror status code c0000024 converted to dos error code 6
2007-09-11T12:39:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		oh
2007-09-11T12:40:00.000Z	dfletcher		wine seems to have verbal diarrhea :P
2007-09-11T12:40:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	i don't liek warnings lol
2007-09-11T12:41:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	I believe they do that so they can easily see what parts of windows they still need to build ;)
2007-09-11T12:41:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		oh
2007-09-11T12:41:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		well yeah if i run it from terminal
2007-09-11T12:41:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		all i have to do is close terminal :)
2007-09-11T12:41:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		now the userver for windows has a prgram called namedate.exe
2007-09-11T12:41:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	nice... if you make a taskbar item, check the "run in terminal" button
2007-09-11T12:42:00.000Z	dfletcher		and you'll get the same thing, but with a button :)
2007-09-11T12:42:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		nice
2007-09-11T12:42:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		i wonder if this is possible
2007-09-11T12:43:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		the userver for windows has a program called namedate.exe which if the server crashes it adds a name and date to the specified files (server logs) and copies them to a folder
2007-09-11T12:43:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		do u think that woudl be possible in this script?
2007-09-11T12:45:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	do you know how I would tell the script to do something if the server crashes?
2007-09-11T12:45:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	so you just want to launch that program after the server exits? just add another statement between "do" and "done", separated by a semi colon... so like:    ... do; wine userver.exe; wine namedate.exe; done  ... now it does 2 things in the loop
2007-09-11T12:46:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		hmm
2007-09-11T12:46:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		so that would run whatever after it exits and then reopen server?
2007-09-11T12:46:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	yeah
2007-09-11T12:46:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		wow
2007-09-11T12:46:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	you're too easily impressed ;P
2007-09-11T12:47:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		yeah i know
2007-09-11T12:47:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	it's pretty basic bash scripting
2007-09-11T12:47:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		im noobish at linux still but on and off user
2007-09-11T12:47:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	well you've picked a good distribution ;D
2007-09-11T12:47:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		so just add what i want it to do under what i have in the while loop?
2007-09-11T12:47:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		the same way?
2007-09-11T12:48:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	I wrote out what you need to do. read it again
2007-09-11T12:48:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		lol ok
2007-09-11T13:07:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		ok if i cd to the directory in a script first will it stay in the directory for all following commands?
2007-09-11T13:09:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	do i need a ; at the end of every command line?
2007-09-11T13:10:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	nope, just when you put multiple statements on one line
2007-09-11T13:12:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	oh ok i have each thing on a seperate line so i shoudl be ok
2007-09-11T13:12:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	how would I print text to the terminal window?
2007-09-11T13:12:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	echo "something to print"
2007-09-11T13:12:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		hah same as dos
2007-09-11T13:12:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		with quotes too?
2007-09-11T13:13:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	also, I can tell you how to get those wine commands to be quiet if you want ;)
2007-09-11T13:13:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		oh yeah
2007-09-11T13:13:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	yes please
2007-09-11T13:13:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	onesec
2007-09-11T13:13:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		k
2007-09-11T13:15:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	something like this (crap I forgot the names of your 2 exes. guessing them):   while /bin/true; do wine server.exe >> /dev/null 2>&1; wine nametest.exe >>/dev/null 2>&1; done
2007-09-11T13:16:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	sticking " >> /dev/null 2>&1" after some command will send all the output to nowhere :)
2007-09-11T13:16:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		so just add >> /dev/null 2>&1 to the end of the wine commands?
2007-09-11T13:16:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	yeah
2007-09-11T13:16:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		kewl
2007-09-11T13:18:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	so for echo does it need the quotes also?
2007-09-11T13:19:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	jsut wanna double check
2007-09-11T13:19:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	it's good practice but not really necessary. your words become arguments to echo, but if you quote it you only send 1 arg. also, sometimes wierd chars can cause trouble. best quote it
2007-09-11T13:19:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	oh ok
2007-09-11T13:20:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	well I copied the windows script and substituded linux commands basically
2007-09-11T13:20:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	so hopefully it should work
2007-09-11T13:24:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	whats unterminated quoted string mean?
2007-09-11T13:25:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	that probably means you forgot an ending quote or tried to put quote chars in your quoted string :P
2007-09-11T13:25:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		I PUT %DATE%
2007-09-11T13:25:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		oops
2007-09-11T13:26:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	hwo do i echo the date and time
2007-09-11T13:26:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	if you know
2007-09-11T13:26:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	just `date` by itself will do that
2007-09-11T13:26:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	 oh ok kewl
2007-09-11T13:27:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	hmm i got the same thing weird
2007-09-11T13:28:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	just echo "words" ?
2007-09-11T13:28:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		Oh
2007-09-11T13:28:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	should be. that's weird
2007-09-11T13:28:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		i bet its the arguments i have for namedate
2007-09-11T13:29:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	wine ./namedate.exe /Z:"Y-m-d H-M-S" "old.log"
2007-09-11T13:29:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		oh i found it
2007-09-11T13:30:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		ok server started
2007-09-11T13:30:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		thats a good sign
2007-09-11T13:32:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	omg i think everything works lol
2007-09-11T13:32:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	except date and time
2007-09-11T13:32:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	for echo
2007-09-11T13:32:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	awesome :)
2007-09-11T13:32:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	well if you want a date in a echo statement, put it in backticks: echo "this is the current date: `date`"  .. that will sub the date in the string
2007-09-11T13:33:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	oh so echo "the server was started at 'date' 'time'" ?
2007-09-11T13:34:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	time doesn't do that :P
2007-09-11T13:34:00.000Z	dfletcher		but for date, you almost have it --- BACK ticks
2007-09-11T13:34:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	aww u cant do time?
2007-09-11T13:34:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	backticks are under the tilde char - `
2007-09-11T13:34:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	date will output the time
2007-09-11T13:34:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		oh
2007-09-11T13:34:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		the tild
2007-09-11T13:34:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	and you can call it twice with formatting to get a separate date and time
2007-09-11T13:35:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	try `man date` to see how to format, but it's like: date +%Y-%m-%d or something like that
2007-09-11T13:35:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	i jsut want it to say  server started at date and time
2007-09-11T13:35:00.000Z	dfletcher		lol man date
2007-09-11T13:35:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		oh
2007-09-11T13:35:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	ok so echo "server started `date whatever format`" ?
2007-09-11T13:35:00.000Z	dfletcher		yes
2007-09-11T13:35:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	kewl
2007-09-11T13:37:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	oh date has time already sweet
2007-09-11T13:37:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	that's what I was saying :P so use a format string to make it say what you want
2007-09-11T13:38:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	or if you're happy with the default then good enough ;)
2007-09-11T13:40:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	how do i rem lines in the script
2007-09-11T13:40:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	for description?
2007-09-11T13:40:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	you mean comments? start the line with # sym
2007-09-11T13:40:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		yea
2007-09-11T13:40:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks		ok
2007-09-11T14:03:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	ok this might sound lame but I want to be able to release this to others how should I zip the files?
2007-09-11T14:05:00.000Z	dfletcher	Ninesvnsicks	cd to the directory above the one you want to archive, then do: tar czvf archivename.tar.gz directory-with-files/
2007-09-11T14:06:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	oh i got it lol
2007-09-11T14:06:00.000Z	Ninesvnsicks	dfletcher	i jsut right clicked
