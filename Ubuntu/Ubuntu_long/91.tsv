2006-03-06T14:48:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	mount: only root can do that
2006-03-06T14:48:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	mount: /dev/hda1 already mounted or /mnt busy
2006-03-06T14:49:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	is hda1 the right partition?
2006-03-06T14:49:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	on my desktoip it says hda1
2006-03-06T14:49:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	if you browse into it, is that the right partition?
2006-03-06T14:50:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	yeah, i couldn't browse it beofre
2006-03-07T11:10:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	look in /usr/lib/firefox/searchplugins
2006-03-07T11:11:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	also ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/searchplugins for ones you've installed yourself
2006-03-07T11:11:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	i deleted them from there
2006-03-07T11:11:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	i deleted them from: home/opt/firefox/searchplugins
2006-03-07T11:11:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	i don't know where those other folders are
2006-03-07T11:12:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	~ means your home directory
2006-03-07T11:13:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	okay, so in my home i don't have mozilla, it is opt
2006-03-07T11:13:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	and then firefox, and i deleted themf rom there
2006-03-07T11:13:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	where is that other folder you mentioned
2006-03-07T11:13:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	in your home directory there will be a .mozilla folder with your firefox profile. the '.' at the start is important
2006-03-07T11:14:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	in my home, there is only
2006-03-07T11:14:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	Desktop, linuxdcpp, opt, websites
2006-03-07T11:14:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	anything starting with a '.' is hidden. do ls -A to see it, or just trust me and 'cd ~/.mozilla'
2006-03-07T11:15:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	okay
2006-03-07T11:16:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	ah, okay
2006-03-07T11:16:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	but in .mozilla..
2006-03-07T11:17:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	there should be a firefox folder, and in that, a randomly names kj324ij34kl.default folder
2006-03-07T11:17:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	the part before ".default" is random so just do an ls to see what it is
2006-03-07T11:17:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	okay, so in. ~/home/.mozilla/fireox/ff1.5/lejxsznc.default/searchplugins
2006-03-07T11:17:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	are only the ones i've installed
2006-03-07T11:18:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	you can also look in /usr/lib/firefox/searchplugins, /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/searchplugins, /usr/lib/mozilla/searchplugins
2006-03-07T11:18:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	where is usr?
2006-03-07T11:19:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	in /
2006-03-07T11:20:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	anything that starts with a '/' is at the root of your filesystem, anything that doesn't start with '/' is relative to your current directory
2006-03-07T11:20:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	in home there is no usr folder
2006-03-07T11:20:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	and i am showing hidden folders
2006-03-07T11:21:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	it's not in your home folder, it's in /. type in 'cd /' and then do an ls
2006-03-07T11:21:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	ah, i'm not trying in terminal, i was navigating in folders
2006-03-07T11:22:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	ah, if you're in nautilus with the side panel, look under filesystem
2006-03-07T11:22:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	ah okay, here we go
2006-03-07T11:24:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	how come i cannot delete the files from this folder?
2006-03-07T11:24:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	because they are owned by root
2006-03-07T11:24:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	aren't i root?
2006-03-07T11:24:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	i haev to do sudo?
2006-03-07T11:24:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	use sudo at the command line
2006-03-07T11:24:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	i hope you're not logged in as root, that's bad form
2006-03-07T11:24:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	i don't know what that means
2006-03-07T11:25:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	sudo del <filename>?
2006-03-07T11:25:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	sudo rm <filename>
2006-03-07T11:25:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	okay, thanks
2006-03-07T11:26:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	you can also do alt-f2 to get a "Run..." dialog and type 'gksudo nautilus --no-dekstop' to get a file browser window with admin privilege (the --no-desktop is important to avoid loading roots desktop over yours)
2006-03-07T11:27:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	what is nautilus?
2006-03-07T11:27:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	fuck, theya re still there
2006-03-07T11:27:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	did you restart firefox?
2006-03-07T11:27:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	yeah
2006-03-07T11:28:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	is there a way i can serach my partition for any file with creative in its name?
2006-03-07T11:29:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	find / -iname "*creative*"
2006-03-07T11:29:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	ah, another place... opt/firefox/searchplugins
2006-03-07T11:29:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	the '-iname' makes it case insensitive. '-name' is case sensitive
2006-03-07T11:30:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	ah, got it
2006-03-07T11:30:00.000Z	mikebot	fangorious	thanks for all the help

2006-03-07T11:33:00.000Z	fangorious	mikebot	'sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.8-plugins gstreamer0.8-plugins-multiverse' should cover you for a large variety of codecs
