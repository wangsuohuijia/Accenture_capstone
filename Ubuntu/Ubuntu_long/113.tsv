2010-09-09T10:23:00.000Z	FalseLobster		and I can't even install linux
2010-09-09T10:23:00.000Z	Emanon		try gksu nautilus FalseLobster
2010-09-09T10:23:00.000Z	Emanon		then just navigate to the file manually in your now root file browser
2010-09-09T10:24:00.000Z	FalseLobster		That opens nautilus as root but it doesn't open archive manager as root
2010-09-09T10:24:00.000Z	Emanon		yea real1adam plug it in go to System>Administration>Hardware Drivers
2010-09-09T10:25:00.000Z	Emanon	FalseLobster	 now go to wherever the archive is in the root file manager
2010-09-09T10:25:00.000Z	Emanon		if you try to open it in file roller from a root nautilus it should force file roller to be root too
2010-09-09T10:25:00.000Z	FalseLobster	Emanon	yea yea.  That opens nautilus as root, but opening hte archive doesn't open it in root
2010-09-09T10:25:00.000Z	FalseLobster		it's still read only
2010-09-09T10:25:00.000Z	Emanon		idk then but it just wants to f you
