2005-12-13T16:37:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	I'll try. What's the problem?
2005-12-13T16:37:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	i want to print a photo (setting 4x6)
2005-12-13T16:38:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	but when i set this size, i doesn't get good on the paper, it only prints at the end of the 4x6 paper
2005-12-13T16:38:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	i don't know why!
2005-12-13T16:38:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	perhaps your placing the paper in the wrong corner?
2005-12-13T16:39:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	print a draft to an A4 sheet, so you know exactly where it will print.
2005-12-13T16:39:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	but, how is that so, this is the good corner
2005-12-13T16:40:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	but it prints also at the end of the page, when the photo paper is almost out of the printer
2005-12-13T16:40:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	which program do you use for printing?
2005-12-13T16:40:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	standard gnome image viewer
2005-12-13T16:41:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	it may be worth leaving the printer settings on standard A4, then open the image in The Gimp, and print from there.
2005-12-13T16:42:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	what are you suspecting?
2005-12-13T16:42:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	Gimp allows you to place the image precisely.
2005-12-13T16:42:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	I'm not suspecting anything. Just suggesting a workaround.
2005-12-13T16:42:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	ok all have to try that
2005-12-13T16:42:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	but i'm not on the computer where de printer was connected to
2005-12-13T16:43:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	if you have a moment, i'll go to the printer and try
2005-12-13T16:43:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	I'll be here for ~ 15 minutes.
2005-12-13T16:43:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	ok
2005-12-13T16:44:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	i'm at the printer now, you say print an a4 with the 4x6 setting in gimp?
2005-12-13T16:45:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	no, use the A4 setting, size the image appropriately in the print dialog and place it in the box according to how you slot in your paper.
2005-12-13T16:46:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	do a draft print to A4 to be sure.
2005-12-13T16:46:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	draft print?
2005-12-13T16:46:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	test print to cheap A4 paper.
2005-12-13T16:47:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	so you know where to place the image in the print dialog.
2005-12-13T16:47:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	leave the printer settings on normal size, but resize the *image* to 4x6.
2005-12-13T16:47:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	you can do that in the print dialogue.
2005-12-13T16:48:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	i have done it, now ill have to print and see if it comes in the beginning of the page
2005-12-13T16:49:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	it's not doing much at all
2005-12-13T16:50:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	you know that you have to set up your printer in the Gimp print dialog?
2005-12-13T16:51:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	what do i have to setup?
2005-12-13T16:51:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	i didn't know, how to setup?
2005-12-13T16:51:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	go through the dialog from top to bottom, put in settings that make sense to you.
2005-12-13T16:52:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	do i have to select a pdd driver? because the printer is not listed
2005-12-13T16:54:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	what driver have you set up outside of Gimp>
2005-12-13T16:54:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	i installed a driver true a installation script i got from a website
2005-12-13T16:54:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	it for a canon 1500
2005-12-13T16:54:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	i have no pdd file
2005-12-13T16:54:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	or is it putted somewhere, so i can select it
2005-12-13T16:56:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	i have found the ppd file
2005-12-13T16:56:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	i try to print now
2005-12-13T16:56:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	okay...
2005-12-13T16:57:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	it doesn't print
2005-12-13T16:58:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	when i load the ppd file, do i have to select a printer, it's now on postscript
2005-12-13T16:58:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	printer model is on postscript
2005-12-13T16:59:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	??
2005-12-13T16:59:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	is your printer listed under Printer Name in the Gimp printing dialog?
2005-12-13T16:59:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	no
2005-12-13T17:00:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	i have loaded the ppd file, al settings for paper anything is for the printere setted up, but i cannot select printer model
2005-12-14T17:00:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	is there anything in Printer Name?
2005-12-14T17:01:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	well, why did you say it wasn't listed?
2005-12-14T17:02:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	anyway, if you have the PPD file, you should be able to print just fine.
2005-12-14T17:02:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	i can't select printer model: it's on postscript
2005-12-14T17:02:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	what should be in command?
2005-12-14T17:03:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	leave that as it was, just point it to the PPD file.
2005-12-14T17:03:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	i did but it doesn't print
2005-12-14T17:04:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	okay, what is in Command right now?
2005-12-14T17:04:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	this is in the command line: lp -s -dPIXMA-iP1500-Ver.2.50 -oraw
2005-12-14T17:06:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	it's hard to diagnose from here.
2005-12-14T17:06:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	i get a printer at te buttom right and there is an task in there, but it just disapears after a minute or so
2005-12-14T17:07:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	if you have Openoffice, you could try and print from Draw - that allows you to resize a picture and place it on the page.
2005-12-14T17:07:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	ok
2005-12-14T17:08:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	how to print from draw in openoffice
2005-12-14T17:09:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	open the image file in Draw. Place the image on the page, print with File - Print.
2005-12-14T17:12:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	you're saying it's working?
2005-12-14T17:12:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	yes it's printing
2005-12-14T17:12:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	it ready
2005-12-14T17:12:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	looking good?
2005-12-14T17:13:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	it's in the corner, but leaving abount 1cm of space on the buttom and 3mm of space on the side
2005-12-14T17:15:00.000Z	soundray	Cybercool	it's a matter of trying. You could also ring Canon support and give them hell :)  I've done that to them, for not supporting my IP5200R under Linux...
2005-12-14T17:15:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	thanks for you help
2005-12-14T17:15:00.000Z	Cybercool	soundray	bye
