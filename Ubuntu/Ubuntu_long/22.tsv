2009-08-04T08:22:00.000Z	gogeta	mdg	yea the arrray org netbook kernel 2.6.29 the defult geenrc .28 serise has wifi issues
2009-08-04T08:23:00.000Z	gogeta	mdg	mine would randomly disconnect untill i upgraded
2009-08-04T08:24:00.000Z	mdg	gogeta	that's the problem deexannihilate  is having

2009-08-04T08:26:00.000Z	gogeta	mdg	eeebuntu has the newer kernel by defult and they support most netbooks just just eee
2009-08-04T08:29:00.000Z	gogeta	mdg	he needs a newer kernel to fix wifi
2009-08-04T08:29:00.000Z	gogeta	mdg	it effects most cards

2009-08-04T08:37:00.000Z	gogeta	mdg	you have to eyther upgrade to 2.6.29 where they fixed it so you can blacklist again or recompile 28 without it

2009-08-10T06:35:00.000Z	gogeta	mdg	nope unless shes asking how to turn it on
