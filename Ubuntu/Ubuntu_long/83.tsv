2010-09-18T01:59:00.000Z	Jesdisciple		if you feel comfortable using sudo to change system thingies
2010-09-18T01:59:00.000Z	Jesdisciple		sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2010-09-18T02:00:00.000Z	Jesdisciple		how's it better to type your password in a GUI than the command-line?
2010-09-18T02:01:00.000Z	Jesdisciple		I'm very curious how it matters...
2010-09-18T02:02:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	gksudo does nice things for gui apps.  In the past, some apps would end up with config files owned by root if you ran them with sudo
2010-09-19T14:53:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	too vague
2010-09-19T14:53:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	old issue
2010-09-19T14:53:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	ok, but if you want help now... you need to give details
2010-09-19T14:53:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	desktop shortcut has command "bash ~/talk.sh"
2010-09-19T14:54:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	still too vague.  Imagine you are me
2010-09-19T14:54:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	it works if I use "/home/user/talk.desktop"
2010-09-19T14:54:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	just trying to understand why bash and the ~ don't work on click
2010-09-19T14:55:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	are you trying to create a .desktop file?
2010-09-19T14:55:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	but they do if the shortcut (not the shell script) is excuted in terminal
2010-09-19T14:55:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	yes, icarus-c: you lost me
2010-09-19T14:56:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	take two minutes organize your thoughts and write a one line explanation of what you are trying to accomplish.  Put relevant details in a pastebin so we can understand what you have attempted so far
2010-09-19T15:15:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	take two minutes organize your thoughts and write a one line explanation of what you are trying to accomplish.  Put relevant details in a pastebin so we can understand what you have attempted so far
2010-09-19T15:16:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	yes, that's what you need to do
2010-09-19T15:17:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	~ won't be translated by whatever gnome uses to execute Exec
2010-09-19T15:18:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	do you know why bash isn't recognized?
2010-09-19T15:18:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	what do you mean "isn't recognized"?
2010-09-19T15:18:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	the command does absolutely nothing when clicked
2010-09-19T15:18:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	yes.
2010-09-19T15:19:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	if I take bash off and leave the ~, I get an error
2010-09-19T15:19:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	running ./talk.desktop in terminal works just fine regardless
2010-09-19T15:19:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	because you have no such file that is literally "~talk.sh".  The Exec line is not the same as your interactive terminal.  ~ is not special there
2010-09-19T15:20:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	yes, I get that - I don't wonder about the error so much as why bash doesn't do anything
2010-09-19T15:20:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	when it's clicked that is
2010-09-19T15:20:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	do you agree that "bash arocehurcaoheuraoedhucgaoeudcaogeudc" as the Exec should not do anything?
2010-09-19T15:21:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	it should pass gibberish to bash...
2010-09-19T15:21:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	bash doesn't seem to be called at all
2010-09-19T15:21:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	did you see my last question?
2010-09-19T15:22:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	yes, and I thot of a test...
2010-09-19T15:23:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	so what's your answer to my question?
2010-09-19T15:23:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	clicking a shortcut with that command (yours) should pass gibberish to bash for execution
2010-09-19T15:24:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	I modified the clickable command to &> output
2010-09-19T15:24:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	the output file is not created, so apparently the command is not being run at all
2010-09-19T15:25:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	course I might be forgetting redirection syntax
2010-09-19T15:25:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	checking now
2010-09-19T15:25:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	run "bash raocheurcaoherchaorchaoercuh" in your terminal
2010-09-19T15:26:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	bash: raocheurcaoherchaorchaoercuh: No such file or directory
2010-09-19T15:26:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	yes, I expect that to be output...
2010-09-19T15:26:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	where exactly?
2010-09-19T15:27:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	pardon?
2010-09-19T15:27:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	where exactly do you expect to see the output?
2010-09-19T15:27:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	in the redirected file, once I'm sure I have my redirection syntax correct
2010-09-19T15:28:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	as I said Exec is not bash
2010-09-19T15:29:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	well, when I did it without bash - that is, ~/talk.sh
2010-09-19T15:29:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	yes?
2010-09-19T15:29:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	it popped up an error dialog
2010-09-19T15:29:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	with bash, I don't even see that
2010-09-19T15:30:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	because it couldn't find the command "~/talk.sh".  On the other hand, the bash command runs fine.  You can check if the output goes to ~/.xsession-errors, but I'm not sure if it does.  The output will just be bash telling you there's no such file as "~/talk.sh", taking the ~ literally
2010-09-19T15:33:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	you can try running in a terminal: bash '~/talk.sh'  .  That's what is happening.
2010-12-23T06:25:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	www-data is the default user and group that apache runs as on ubuntu
2010-12-23T06:25:00.000Z	jrib	Jesdisciple	is that a trick question?
2010-12-23T06:25:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	not afaik
2010-12-23T06:26:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	jrib	ah, so they have the same name - thanks
