2007-04-27T05:49:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	install the Gnome ALSA Mixer and check to see if the "surround" slider is up or down or muted
2007-04-27T05:49:00.000Z	martin	patrick_	what do you mean by install? Ubuntu doesn't come with it?
2007-04-27T05:50:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	well it has a cli version
2007-04-27T05:50:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	type into a terminal "alsamixer" then hit enter
2007-04-27T05:51:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	nice one :)
2007-04-27T05:52:00.000Z	martin	patrick_	but I still don't know what to do to get the sound going
2007-04-27T05:52:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	what is the Surround slider at
2007-04-27T05:53:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	use the arrow keys to turn that up then test sound
2007-04-27T05:56:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	did you change the surround value??
2007-04-27T05:56:00.000Z	martin	patrick_	Yes
2007-04-27T05:58:00.000Z	martin	patrick_	I have switched every option i can find to ALSA (instead of OSS or whatever) and made sure my volumes are up.
2007-04-27T05:58:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	try installing the gnome alsa mixer to see if that'll aid you
2007-04-27T06:00:00.000Z	martin	patrick_	Do you know how I can get my resolution to 1280x800 ?
2007-04-27T06:01:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	yeah, "gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf" then you can add it under the appropriate section
2007-04-27T06:02:00.000Z	martin	patrick_	I'm just worried that the reason the resolution isn't showing up in the first place is because the proper drivers are installed. This probably isn't the case though, is it?
2007-04-27T06:03:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	this should be fine
2007-04-27T06:05:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	how you gettin on?
2007-04-27T06:05:00.000Z	martin	patrick_	I'm frustrated lol. The correction resolutions seem to already be set. They're just not showing up in the Screen Resolutions dialog
2007-04-27T06:06:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	what you could do is remove the rest and leave only the one you want
2007-04-27T06:06:00.000Z	martin	patrick_	actually believe it or not that is already the case
2007-04-27T06:06:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	???
2007-04-27T06:07:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	very strange....which laptop are you using
2007-04-27T06:08:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	could you paste the contents of your xorg.conf
2007-04-27T06:08:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	use ubuntu pastebin
2007-04-27T06:12:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	that chipset is normally ready to go right out of the box, have you changed anything that may have effected your display
2007-04-27T06:16:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	i think I got it
2007-04-27T06:17:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	ok "sudo aptitude install 915resolution" then follow the X Server part of this guide http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~sarunas/D620F6.html
2007-04-27T06:17:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	gimme a shout if you have any trouble
2007-04-27T06:18:00.000Z	martin	patrick_	I have a questionb
2007-04-27T06:18:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	shoot
2007-04-27T06:19:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	you will get used to the command line quicker than you think, its all learning by doing
2007-04-27T06:19:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	plus you have this channel to help you along the way
2007-04-27T06:21:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	once your in full working order then the real fun begins

2007-04-27T06:26:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	now did you install the 915resolution package?
2007-04-27T06:27:00.000Z	martin	patrick_	Yes. I'm trying to change the text file but it's read only and I dont have permission to change that
2007-04-27T06:28:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	then do "gksudo gedit /etc/default/915resolution" and enter the values on that guide but only with your 1280x800
2007-04-27T06:29:00.000Z	martin	patrick_	gksudo gedit allows you to edit system files I guess?
2007-04-27T06:30:00.000Z	martin	patrick_	anyway I did what you said.
2007-04-27T06:30:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	gksudo is to run graphical apps as root user
2007-04-27T06:31:00.000Z	patrick_	martin	now save that file and restart X using ctrl + alt + backspace
2007-04-27T06:40:00.000Z	martin	patrick_	!!!!!!!!
