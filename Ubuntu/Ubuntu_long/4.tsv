2008-12-27T21:31:00.000Z	cubevanbaby		hey hey question for you all. I'm using xfce and thunbar and feh. I am now able to right click and set a wallpaper which is awesome. I wanted to try getting it to work at startup and added the following to my autostarted programs eval `cat $HOME/.fehbg` & but it doesn't seem to work. Then I tried using another feh command where I specified a filename but I can;t remember off the top. didn't work though. LOL any
2008-12-27T21:31:00.000Z	cubevanbaby		one have any other ideas?
2008-12-27T21:32:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	try making a file called .xsession. start it at the top with   #! /bin/bash
2008-12-27T21:32:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	then put your feh command in it next. let me know if that works ok
2008-12-27T21:33:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	you're welcome, i just hope that works ok for you. i'm pretty sure it will though
2008-12-27T21:40:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	hmmm, does sound weird. do you already have a file in your home dir named .xsession?
2008-12-27T21:45:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	oh, look at the permissions of that file. make sure that you do have write permission to it
2008-12-27T21:46:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	argh you're right I don't apparently
2008-12-27T21:46:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok, roger
2008-12-27T21:47:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	who is the owner of the file? show me the output of  ls -l .xsession
2008-12-27T21:48:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	crap I think it belongs to the other user. hold on -_-' lol
2008-12-27T21:49:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	in your home dir? i don't know why it would....
2008-12-27T21:50:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	-rw-r--r-- 2 root root 23 2008-07-27 17:50 .xsession
2008-12-27T21:51:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	have you ever started X Windows as the root user somehow?
2008-12-27T21:52:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	not that I know of... :-/
2008-12-27T21:52:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok, hang on
2008-12-27T21:57:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok, if your username in you system is cubevanbaby, then do the following command --> sudo chown cubevanbaby.cubevanbaby .xsession
2008-12-27T21:59:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok, cool. you're welcome. :-) good luck
2008-12-27T22:49:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	so... I may have done something majorly wrong with editing .xsession now it just keeps bringing me back to the login screen over and over agian :-/
2008-12-27T23:09:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	have you received help for the .xsession problem?
2008-12-27T23:09:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	i was away....
2008-12-27T23:19:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	yes thanks. lol fixing it now
2008-12-27T23:20:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok, roger. just curious, how are you getting it fixed? what line did you remove?
2008-12-27T23:21:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	- usr/bin/icewm -_-''
2008-12-27T23:21:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	if you own a file or have proper permission, always make a backup copy of the file before editing it
2008-12-27T23:21:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	roger that
2008-12-27T23:22:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	yeah I should have done that i don't know why i didn't was taking gambling and lost lol
2008-12-27T23:22:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	i've made the same mistake a few times. i think we all have, hehe.
2008-12-27T23:34:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	:-)
2008-12-27T23:36:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	well it's true! XD you guys are reaching out and helping people get started on linux and none of you have to be doing this. certainly wasn't around I don't think when my friend started using it oh gosh like a decade ago maybe more. and if so it certainly wasn't as popular or out there as it is now
2008-12-27T23:39:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	i like helping, it's fun. and we need as many linux users as possible! and i think, the more people get help, the more they stick with it
2008-12-27T23:42:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	it's totally true. I think the thing that scares people the most is that fear of lack of support. I know I was scared at first. then I found the channel. lol. and everyone is so awesome. there are so many people who want to help and offer to teach it's amazing. I did not expect after 3 days to even get as far as I am now. I thought I would be sitting here crying sucking my thumb with a broken lap
2008-12-27T23:43:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	lol. i am happy to hear you haven't regretted taking the plunge
2008-12-28T00:02:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	what's happening? i think all you said was the line that was missing in there was...  /usr/bin/icewm-session   ....you didn't just add that back into it?
2008-12-28T00:03:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	or are you having a different issue now?
2008-12-28T00:05:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	- it keeps giving me a line highlighted in red with an error E486: Pattern not found :usr
2008-12-28T00:06:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	what does? what are you trying to do exactly and what's giving you this red line?
2008-12-28T00:06:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	use pastebin if you have to
2008-12-28T00:07:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	would you like to start with a fresh .xsession file? if so, just delete the current one and i'll give you steps to take to make sure a fresh new one is created, from scratch
2008-12-28T00:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	on second though, just in case, rename the current one. ;-)
2008-12-28T00:08:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	sounds good to me
2008-12-28T00:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok, one moment
2008-12-28T00:10:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ignore the instructions in here about running the 'Xorg -configure' command. other than ignoring that, follow the instructions and it should create a fresh new .xsession file for you. after it has been created, then there should be no problem with you adding your 'feh' command to it
2008-12-28T00:11:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	1) determine what display_manager you use with --> cat /etc/X11/default-display-manager  2) log out of x-windows  3) Ctrl+Alt+F1  4) login to the console termminal  4) sudo invoke-rc.d <display_manager> stop (for example -->  invoke-rc.d gdm stop  <--, this shuts down x-windows completely)  5) sudo Xorg -configure (this command should create a full xorg.conf.new file in the root users home directory)
2008-12-28T00:12:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	and ignore steps 6 & 7 as well, of course
2008-12-28T00:12:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ignore steps 5, 6 & 7
2008-12-28T00:13:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	got it thanks. I'll give this a whirl and let you know what happens\
2008-12-28T00:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	you can copy and paste all of that into a file and save to your hard drive to make it easier.
2008-12-28T00:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok, good luck :-)
2008-12-28T00:13:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	- already have lol
2008-12-28T00:19:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	yes...  that's to determing what you will use for the invoke-rc.d command
2008-12-28T00:22:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	the menu up top in 8.10...  System --> Logout
2008-12-28T00:24:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	but that's in compiz... not sure for xfce. it shoukld be right down there on your menu somewhere
2008-12-28T00:24:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	I don't have a menu :-/ when I type that out it returns /usr/bin/xdm and then brings me back to root@user:~#
2008-12-28T00:26:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok, this will kill everything you have open.. but here's how you can do it.   invoke-rc.d gdm stop   ...if gdm is your display manager
2008-12-28T00:28:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	just do that from a terminal while you're in X
2008-12-28T00:28:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	can you boot into normal mode?
2008-12-28T00:29:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	what happens when you try to boot into normal mode?
2008-12-28T00:29:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	no that's why it's so horrficially broken lol
2008-12-28T00:29:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	if I go to login the screen goes black and brings me back to the login screen
2008-12-28T00:30:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	so then I went into recovery so everything is text based now and I'm a bit lost because I've never been in the recovery console. from there I selected root
2008-12-28T00:30:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok, at that point, try following the instructions, start with step #3
2008-12-28T00:31:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	and don't bogart that j
2008-12-28T00:32:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	roger
2008-12-28T00:47:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	ok done XD do I just exit and try to reboot normally now or is there other stuff to do/
2008-12-28T00:48:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	when you say 'done'. what do you mean exactly?
2008-12-28T00:50:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	- nm lol I went back to your message and you said that once I finished off the steps that it would recreate .xconfig for me. lol
2008-12-28T00:50:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok. get to it now
2008-12-28T00:50:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ahh! i see
2008-12-28T00:51:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	just make sure you rename the .xsession file
2008-12-28T00:51:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	then start at step #3 and ignore steps 5, 6, & 7
2008-12-28T00:53:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	ok cool. so do I just boot up normally or do I need to do all that in recovery?
2008-12-28T00:53:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	do this by booting up normally, or trying to anyway
2008-12-28T00:57:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	sadly didn't work :(
2008-12-28T00:59:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok.. i don't know what you've done to breakit exactly then i guess. what happened when you did   Ctrl+Alt+F1  ..? you have to tell me these kinds of things rather than just say it's still broken or doesn't work
2008-12-28T01:00:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	sorry lol hitting ctrl+alt+f1 didn't work in recovery so I hit exit and booted normally
2008-12-28T01:00:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok, and?
2008-12-28T01:01:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	well when I tried to log in it kept looping
2008-12-28T01:01:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	as i said.. start at Step #3
2008-12-28T01:02:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	step #3 is NOT logging in
2008-12-28T01:02:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	yeah I just clued in when I was at the login screen hitting crtl+alt+f1 worked and i was like oh crap that's what he meant
2008-12-28T01:02:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	rofl
2008-12-28T01:05:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	yep... hehe
2008-12-28T01:19:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok, you're using xdm?
2008-12-28T01:20:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	yes, gdm is gnome
2008-12-28T01:21:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	if you're a kde user, you might want to install kdm  --> sudo apt-get install kdm

2008-12-28T01:56:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ahhh! finally!
2008-12-28T01:56:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	yes
2008-12-28T01:57:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok, now. are you sure that you have renamed the .xsession file that was in your normal user's home directory?
2008-12-28T01:58:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	 no I never renamed .xsession. don't know how.
2008-12-28T01:59:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	what is your normal user's name in ubuntu?
2008-12-28T01:59:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	ilmob
2008-12-28T02:00:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok, now, the next command is -->  cd /home/ilmod
2008-12-28T02:01:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	sorry.. typo
2008-12-28T02:01:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok, now, the next command is -->  cd /home/ilmob
2008-12-28T02:01:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	no it's cool I'm starting to understand
2008-12-28T02:02:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok, now... the next command is  -->  mv -v .xession xsession-bad
2008-12-28T02:04:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok, good. now, to try and help make sure you don't do any damage as root user, let's get you out of your normal user's home directory  -->   cd    ...then simply press Enter
2008-12-28T02:04:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	ok cool now I'm back into root@ilmob:~#
2008-12-28T02:05:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok, next command is...   invoke-rc.d xdm stop
2008-12-28T02:06:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	done! :)
2008-12-28T02:07:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok, for the next command, let me know if there is any problem, which i'm sure you'll do  -->  invoke-rc.d xdm start   ...if you get any complaint, let me know
2008-12-28T02:09:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	totally worked! brilliant!!
2008-12-28T02:09:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	w00ooties!
2008-12-28T02:12:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	now that you have a good .xsession file, make a backup of it. then edit it.... put in your 'feh' command after the  #! /bin/bash (which is at the top of the file) and follow the feh command with an ampersand... like so
2008-12-28T02:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	feh --bg-scale /usr/share/xfce4/backdrops/paltanen.jpg &
2008-12-28T02:14:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	put that command after the #! /bin/bash and before any other command, before the /usr/bin/icewm-session  command or whatever the /usr/bin/session command is named
2008-12-28T02:16:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	all good!
2008-12-28T02:17:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok. great! you did see how to add the 'feh' command, right?
2008-12-28T02:17:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	sure did :)
2008-12-28T02:17:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	ok, cool
2008-12-28T02:19:00.000Z	cubevanbaby	onetinsoldier	thanks for the walkthrough i totally understand now what you were asking me to do end to end
2008-12-28T02:19:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cubevanbaby	hehe. you're welcome
