2007-08-17T09:51:00.000Z	borovy3488		anyone good with Beryl??
2007-08-17T09:51:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 the ppl in #beryl are
2007-09-20T08:46:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	we need specific questions
2007-09-20T08:55:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	the image might be borked,  get the most recent version of devede from the site
2007-09-20T08:56:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	i just downloaded it from there today
2007-09-20T08:57:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 there is also an issue with mencoder you need to dl and install the package at the bottom of the page
2007-09-20T08:58:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 are you sure the iso fits on the dvd ? the size bar in devede is not reliable
2007-09-20T08:59:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	I don'T allow private msg please talk to me in the channel
2007-09-20T09:00:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	yea, man I'm positive, I looked at the file size, it is only 2.8 GB
2007-09-20T09:01:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 I burned one today but it was made a few days ago with the previous version 3.1.3 I think,  and it worked fine,  I don't know if there might be a but in 3.2  I would try to make another iso and see if you can burn that one
2007-09-20T09:02:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	damn it.  How long does it take you to make an iso?  It took me literally 8 hours. Convert from AVI.
2007-09-20T09:03:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	 Also, I just tried to burn the iso as a file to a dvd, to try on friends cpu, and it didn't work.  Could it be my burner is screwed up???
2007-09-20T09:03:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	it varies,   8 hrs is a bit on the long side ,  one 2hrs avi would take me 3 hrs max I would expect,  but the more recent devede seems a lot slower then when I started out
2007-09-20T09:13:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	did you get my last rant about earlier versions being faster ?
2007-09-20T09:14:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 or do you mean package wise ?
2007-09-20T09:15:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 personnaly I  make my dvd then save it ,  then wait until I go to bed to start the encoding , that way I have it the next morning
2007-09-20T09:15:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	Also, I just tried to burn the iso as a file to a dvd, to try on friends cpu, and it didn't work.  Could it be my burner is screwed up???
2007-09-20T09:15:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 that is a possibliity,  what was the error msg ?
2007-09-20T09:17:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	just the bit where it says ti fails
2007-09-20T09:19:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 I notice,  I jsut need the part wihere it says it failed and why
2007-09-20T09:20:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	:-[ WRITE@LBA=0h failed with SK=3h/ASC=0Ch/ACQ=80h] : Input/output error
2007-09-20T09:21:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	that is fine,  one of two things, possibly,  bad media or borked burner
2007-09-20T09:22:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	OK, but why wouldn't it just burn the file to a dvd?
2007-09-20T09:23:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	because you either ahve bad media ( dvds) or your dvd burner is borked
2007-09-20T09:23:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 I don'T think it has anyting to do with the burning program or the file you are trying to burn ,  try a dvd from another batch and blow some air in the burner, might help
2007-09-20T09:24:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	ok ill try that
2007-09-20T09:27:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	i tried blowing air into the drive, and I tried a dvd from near the bottom of my stack, still nothing...
2007-09-20T09:27:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 any problems reading dvds ?
2007-09-20T09:28:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	nope, i just tried and it worked perfectly
2007-09-20T09:28:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 you mightwant to try reintalling k3b but I donT havemuch hope , take the dvd burner back to the store before the warranty expires
2007-09-20T09:29:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	I can't its in a laptop.  Does this mean i need a new computer?
2007-09-20T09:30:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	probably not, it can probably be replace, but don'T panick yet,  try burning to a cd see if that works, try a bunch of other stuff,  try but at this point there realy isn't more I can suggest
2007-09-20T09:32:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 not to put a damper on things but mine did that to,  it worked occasionnaly,( I thought I just bought a bad batch of dvds) but it was borked
2007-09-20T09:33:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	thats great to hear.  Oh well, its working for now, when I need to burn another, ill just keep trying.  better than buying a new drive I guess.
2007-09-20T09:33:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 I wish you the best but I won'T hold my breath
2007-09-20T09:34:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	thats again for the help, I might be back soon, you never know
2007-09-20T09:40:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	oh yea, thanks for that
2007-09-20T09:57:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	I got another question for ya:: I burned the dvd and it will play on my tv, but there are lines across the screen throughout the entire movie, any ideas??
2007-10-03T09:11:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 the ppl in #azureus-support can
2007-10-03T09:12:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 can I recommend  deluge-torrent or utorrent running on wine
2007-10-03T09:13:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 azurues is notorious for false nat errors
2007-10-03T09:14:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 and hellish to fix,  I know I did support in there for 6 months
2007-10-03T09:14:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	thanks. I did test it again and it says it is ok, but the best speed I can get is 3KBs
2007-10-03T09:15:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 not all torrents are created equal,  try  an ubuntu torrent ,  they are usualy quite fast
2007-10-04T05:42:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	what is your bittorrent problem ?
2007-10-04T05:43:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	are you always on here, man?  My problem is that I have forwarded all the ports, and Can You See Me says that they are open.  I have tried Azureus and BitTornado as well.  All only give about 4 KB max.
2007-10-04T05:44:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 what is the torrent you are using ?
2007-10-04T05:44:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	what do you mean?  its a movie from pirate bay
2007-10-04T05:45:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 if you want to test your bittorrent you should get one of the fast torrent , like a distro for testing,  goto   www.utorrent.com,  check in the guide section ,  open the setup guide, there are a few good torrents for testing in there
2007-10-04T05:46:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	Thanks ill check it out.
2007-10-09T08:39:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 state the problem
2007-10-09T08:40:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	I have waited for a very long time for it to convert the files.  then it said that it failed to create the dvd tree.  So, I was just wondering how I make the iso files where Devede doesnt have to convert the files, since theyre already in the correct format.
2007-10-09T08:41:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	I also was wondering if there was any way to shrink or compress the .iso files.  I have a 4.7 GB iso, and it needs to be smaller to fit on a dvd
2007-10-09T08:42:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 you'll have to look around the dialog boxes but ther are option box that state  that the file is already in mpeg4 format and there is a box to create jsut the dvd structure and not the tree
2007-10-09T08:43:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	don'T rely on the  progress bar to much ,  it's not wholy reliable , I can go up to 200 % and ti fits,  trial and error on that bit I am afraid
2007-10-09T08:43:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	 and be aware  it's 4.7 gigabits not gigaBytes,  it's about 4.4 gigabytes
2007-10-09T08:46:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	OK i found the option and selected it.  It greatly reduced the size of the bar.  It is at 108%.  Seems more accurate.  Is it?
2007-10-09T08:47:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	since not  re-encoding will take place it is probably more on the nose yes
2007-10-09T08:47:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	dang it, OK.  Thanks for the help
2007-10-09T08:50:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	OK, new problem.  When I start it, it automatically says "failed to create the DVD tree.  Maybe you ran out of disk space."  I have 40 GB free.
2007-10-09T08:52:00.000Z	Pelo	borovy3488	I occasionnaly get stuff like that to,  it takes a lot of diskspace apprently to do some of those operations,  I donT' know how to get around it asside from selecting a diffrente partiton to save the file ( last operation before starting the actual encoding)
2007-10-09T08:52:00.000Z	borovy3488	Pelo	thanks again
