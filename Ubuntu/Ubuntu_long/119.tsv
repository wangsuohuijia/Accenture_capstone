2006-08-22T08:14:00.000Z	natural20		so why does ubuntu have a GUI if you can't move stuff to folders using it
2006-08-22T08:15:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	you can if you want. But generally they try to make it a bit more difficult than drag and drop in order to help compensate for user error. natrual20, do gksudo nautilus and you can use the gui to move stuff to folders
2006-08-22T08:45:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	why no update to dapper?
2006-08-22T08:46:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	you should be able to just download whatever they have on the firefox website. Extract it to /opt and run it from there. I believe firefox distributes frozen binaries. Not sure though. Been a long time since I haven't gotten firefox from apt-get
2006-08-22T09:01:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	ok open up a terminal and do cd /opt
2006-08-22T09:02:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	open up a terminal and cd to where ever you want to install it
2006-08-22T09:05:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	if you are doing it in /opt, which is the purpose of that directory. For just this reason, then you would do sudo. But others seem to think the /opt directory is bad. I defer to them I guess
2006-08-22T09:08:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	do you still want to install ff 1.5?
2006-08-22T09:08:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	please
2006-08-22T09:09:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	ok it is going to have to be in your home directory because they seem to not like it being in /opt and also that helps a lot with permission issues
2006-08-22T09:09:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	so replace /opt with /home?
2006-08-22T09:09:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	natural20, just open up a fresh terminal, you will be in the right directory
2006-08-22T09:10:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	do "wget http://www.mozilla.com/products/download.html?product=firefox-1.5.0.6&os=linux&lang=en-US"
2006-08-22T09:12:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	tell me when that finishes
2006-08-22T09:13:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	finished
2006-08-22T09:13:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	do "tar xf firefox-1.5.0.6.tar.gz" this will extract the file
2006-08-22T09:14:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	ok now. How do you want to launch this. An icon on the desktop or in the menus or panel or what?
2006-08-22T09:15:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	tar: firefox-1.5.0.6.tar.gz: Cannot open: No such file or directory
2006-08-22T09:15:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	do ls
2006-08-22T09:17:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	go to here http://www.mozilla.com/products/download.html?product=firefox-1.5.0.6&os=linux&lang=en-US in a web browser and download firefox. Save it to your username directory if you can
2006-08-22T09:18:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	is my username directory home?
2006-08-22T09:19:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	it will be /home/username
2006-08-22T09:19:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	it should say your username in the download dialog of firefox when you choose to download it
2006-08-22T09:21:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	my downloads go to my desktop, home does not have a username folder.
2006-08-22T09:22:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	just put it in your desktop that is fine. We will move it later
2006-08-22T09:22:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	i lied, home does have a username folder.  the file is there
2006-08-22T09:22:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	ok, open up a terminal and do cd
2006-08-22T09:23:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	then do tar xf firefox-1.5.0.6.tar.gz
2006-08-22T09:24:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	was that successful or what
2006-08-22T09:24:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	the terminal just gave a new command line, that's it
2006-08-22T09:24:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	perfect
2006-08-22T09:25:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	how do you want to run it. An icon on the desktop. A menu entry or what
2006-08-22T09:25:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	icon on the taskbar would be ideal, but i'll take anything.  desktop is fine
2006-08-22T09:26:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	to me taskbar = applications, places, system, etc
2006-08-22T09:26:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	ok, go to applications>accessories>alacarte menu editor
2006-08-22T09:27:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	i have no alacarte menu editor :( sorry
2006-08-22T09:27:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	when you get in there click on internet and then do file>new entry
2006-08-22T09:27:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	oh yeah breezy
2006-08-22T09:29:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	if you want to icon, click on icon and the path should be /home/username/firefox/icons, of course replace username with your username
2006-08-22T09:30:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	i click on the icon, but i get this error: Failed to execute child process "~firefox/firefox" (no such filre or directory)
2006-08-22T09:31:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	you have to use ~/firefox/firefox, the / is important after the `
2006-08-22T09:32:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	my command is this:  ~/firefox/firefox
2006-08-22T09:32:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	error still
2006-08-22T09:34:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	nothing happens with new command line
2006-08-22T09:35:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	put that in the command part of the launcher not in the command line
2006-08-22T09:36:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	put that command in the command line now and see if it works
2006-08-22T09:39:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	./firefox-bin: error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2006-08-22T09:43:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	are you still there
2006-08-22T09:44:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	yes, it is doing stuff
2006-08-22T09:45:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	YES!
2006-08-22T09:45:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	redo that launcher thing and put that command in it
2006-08-22T09:46:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	you mean you just clicked the launcher and it worked?
2006-08-22T09:46:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	correct
2006-08-22T09:46:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	ok well it should have worked originally but the library got in the way
2006-08-22T09:47:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	thank you so much
2006-08-23T06:40:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	give me a link to one such page
2006-08-23T06:40:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	they are pages you need to be logged in or a member of, such as MyEbay or Yahoo Groups message boards.
2006-08-23T06:42:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	can you give me a link. Because those pages might not display for a variety of reasons. The fact that you have to be logged into or a member of them would not affect thier ability to be displayed
2006-08-23T06:42:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/epicduels/messages
2006-08-23T06:43:00.000Z	bruenig	natural20	what is not displaying on that, The top part (I ask because there is a flash animation there) or the entire page just won't load?
2006-08-23T06:45:00.000Z	natural20	bruenig	without fail i can get to that page, but once i start to navigate portions not available to the public, the page fails to load.
