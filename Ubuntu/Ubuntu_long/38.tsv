2006-04-10T13:34:00.000Z	PwcrLinux		Hello, I have a question about updates notification, should I ticked all of them or I choose some of them?
2006-04-10T13:34:00.000Z	_jason	PwcrLinux	choose the ones you want.  If bandwidth is not an issue, I would just choose all
2006-04-10T13:35:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	_jason	i am on cable connection, and should I choose all of them?
2006-04-10T13:36:00.000Z	_jason	PwcrLinux	which dialog are you referring to exactly?
2006-04-10T13:36:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	_jason	next to my battery icon
2006-04-10T13:38:00.000Z	_jason	PwcrLinux	as long as you haven't added outside repos, you should be ok
2006-04-10T13:39:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	_jason	okay, should I take it all of them to update it or some of them? I am on the lappy
2006-04-10T13:39:00.000Z	_jason	PwcrLinux	all are fine
2006-04-10T13:40:00.000Z	_jason	PwcrLinux	maybe that will help you
2006-04-10T13:40:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	_jason	okay great and thanks I'm gonna updating now..
2006-04-10T13:57:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	_jason	it's works great in the updates and rebooted the box :)
2006-04-11T07:23:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	_jason	polpak left a channel, and I needed up with a DVD movie play.. and I already installed the ccs and others, and the DVD cannot play, menus overlapped other menus, had to eject the DVD out by the mouse..
2006-04-11T07:23:00.000Z	_jason	PwcrLinux	you mean libdvdcss?
2006-04-11T07:24:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	_jason	no, it's in the restricted wiki site..
2006-04-11T07:26:00.000Z	_jason	PwcrLinux	did you ever run /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh to install libdvdcss?
2006-04-11T07:28:00.000Z	_jason	PwcrLinux	what player are you using?  and is the problem only that the dvd loads but the menus are screwed up?
2006-04-11T07:28:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	_jason	Totem
2006-04-11T07:28:00.000Z	_jason	PwcrLinux	totem with xine or gstreamer backend?
2006-04-11T07:29:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	_jason	non theme players, just plain totem
2006-04-11T07:29:00.000Z	_jason	PwcrLinux	for dvd's I like xine, try installing gxine or xine-ui (or totem-xine if you want)
2006-04-11T07:30:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	_jason	Okay, how I get the xine? I looked at other site looks good, does they have CC and stubtitles?
2006-04-11T07:31:00.000Z	_jason	PwcrLinux	what is CC?
2006-04-11T07:31:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	_jason	closed caption
2006-04-11T07:31:00.000Z	_jason	PwcrLinux	I'll check them for you, I have never used it
2006-04-11T07:32:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	_jason	okay
2006-04-11T07:32:00.000Z	_jason	PwcrLinux	yes, I checked xine-ui and gxine and both have subtitle preferences.  I think gxine looks nicer in gnome, you should try that one imo
2006-04-11T07:34:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	_jason	my DVD movies either CC and stubtitles. single player should have both CC or Stubtitle. just make sure it's both there..
2006-04-11T07:35:00.000Z	_jason	PwcrLinux	just install gxine and try it :)  you can always remove it with one click if you don't like it
2006-04-11T07:35:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	_jason	the totem only have stubtitles, no CC in other options..
2006-04-11T07:35:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	_jason	okay how I get the gxine?
2006-04-11T07:36:00.000Z	_jason	PwcrLinux	enable the universe repository and use synaptic
